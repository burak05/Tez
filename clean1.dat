But they approached it as heavenly body, something holy and not reachable. Newton approached astronomy as phisical, uncharted and lot to learn from. He and other scientist at that age calculated a lot of space's veriaties and used that information to calculate other things and understand earth and what is beyond earth."	12

They used them to look more closely at the stars and planets. There are 2 methods of studying astronomy.First is theoretical astronomy which uses math to explain the observations and predict what is going to happen. Second is observational astronomy which with the telescopes and cameras, observing the astronomical objects.	-20

However,  Newton deflects light again but this time Newton used orange light that was produced the white light at first deflection.  But this time only realized the orange light.  in other words,  Newton realized the white light isn't pure,  and realized light's spectrum.   
20210808017	:::	 According to Hooke  light was a pure white but according to Newton light is a mixed colors. So He was use 2 prism for dispute Hooke the first prism was a colorless and second one is a orange after that he setup the light for pass the light through first prism and than he put the 2 line object this object have a little space between they and the light pass it through and than the light pass through orange prism and if Newton think true the light should be orange and in the last step light was orange so Newton was accurate.

20200808805	:::	 He arranged a prism so the sun light coming from a hole of a shatter he had made in his bedroom wendow so it passes and projected a colore light on a screen.   then he isoltead one of the colors by a slit and passed it in into another prism .  he only saw the the isololated color.   
20190808021	:::	 He split the day light into its components using a prism,  thus showing that day light is not a single color,  but a combination of seven colors.  
20220808606	:::	 Newton did prism experiment to observe if day light pure or has more color in it.   
20200808063	:::	 refract light with glass prism 
20220808005	:::	<p id="isPasted">Newton used 2 prisms to split white light into a spectrum of colors.  This was already known that prism provide us a spectrum in that time.  Then he observed no separation when split one color into the second prism.  After this case,  he decided that white light is composed of various colors.  
20220808051	:::	 he choosed 2 prism. After that he izolate the orange colour and put the orange colour throught second prism. He did not execute any light. So he concluded white colour made up another colours.  
20220808608	:::	 Newton checked if White color is pure.  He purchased a prism.  it was known that rainbow effect can be obtained by transmitting White light.  He isolated the orange color and pass it through second prism.  He found no other colors existed behind the second prism.  So he concluded that White color is made up other colors called spectra 
20220808060	:::	
20220808026	:::	 hooke observed the tissues and he saw the rainbow colors  .  He tought that the colors are added to pure white light .    But newton had experimant and the white light move thorugh a prism at 45 degree by him . The white light were split into the rainbow colors and he islotated the orange .  The orange color moved through a prism by him and there were no any color behind of the prims .  He tough that the white light made up the rainbow color 
20230808049	:::	 At the time there were 2 theories about the light one was Robert Hooke's and the other was newton's.   Hooke was saying that the white light was pure and the colours were added by the materials that it went through.   Newton was saying that white light already involved other colours.   He brought 2 prisms and went to a lightless room.   He took a light source and made the light go through one prism and divided it into it's spectrum.   Then he used 2 fons like papers or something like that to isolate one spectrum  (in this case it was orange light) .   After he isolated he made the light go through the second prism.   Now if Hooke was right the prism should have added the other colours to the light again.   But it didn't happen which means newton was right.  
20220808002	:::	 i don't know what to say.  Sorry for my answers.  
20210808604	:::	 newton's experiment is light prism.  it is a triangle prisma maded by glass.  newton use this prisma and seperate day light to rainbow colors.  
20200808062	:::	 He use the pyramid prizma to show the white light get participated to other lights. Which means that the compose of the all lights is the white light.  
20220808062	:::	 He used another prism and learned that the white is the combine of all colors.  
20230808615	:::	 he used prisma to observe the behavior of light.  He observed that when white light is transfered within prisma it seperates rainbow colour.  after isolating a colour and transfered again into second prisma it doesnt change.  that shows that white light is not pure and made up of spectrum 
20220808055	:::	 Hooke was thinking white light is pure.  Newton,  with using two prisms,  firstly isolated the orange color and after use other prism and he observed that every light color has own refracting spectrum angle.  
20210808065	:::	
20200808020	:::	 Newton said white color is not pure.  newton used a prisma.  he observe the white color through the prisma and find out that white is contains all colors and not pure.  
20220808038	:::	 Hooks said prism adds color to each other.  So Newton worked on it.  He used prisms.  He sent the white light to prism with a 45 degree and white light split to other colors.  Each color has own spesific spectrum and reflaction's angle.  He find white light composed of other color.  Also he sent orange to a prisim and he saw orange again.  He said just white color is composed of other color.  
20200808072	:::	 invented microscpoe.  experiment newton did to explain the day light to dispute hook,  so microscope.   
20220808072	:::	 He proved that white light composed of the other lights.  He send white light rays into a prism.  And white light splits into rainbow colors.  And isolated the oreange light and passed it again in a prism and orange light doesn't split any other colors.  So he concluded white color made up of other colors.  
20200808038	:::	 Newton purchased prism and did so many experiments with prism. He passed into day light to prism and then seperate orange color from others,  recognized that white color-day light contains other colors of rainbow. Also Newton designed telescope for observe planets-large object.  Robert Hooke invented microscope for observe microworld-microorganisms.  Robert Hooke looked into Plants with microscope and saw the many rectangles.  Later he called rectangles, '' cell '' .  
20200808080	:::	 Newton used prisms to show that white light is made up of different colors,  against what people believed before and helping us understand how daylight and colors work.  
20190808035	:::	 He used a prism.  He send light trough it and see a rainbow effect.  Then he isolated the orange color and pass it trough a second prism.  He see there is no other color and said that colors can be transmit by white color.  
20220808057	:::	 Newton purchase a prism and he used for refraction from prism.  First of all ,  he refraction white light and he just reflecting orange color to prism .  He hope this experimentation result orange color show white light but this not happened.  So that he thought white light is combined color of rainbow colors.   
20190808034	:::	 He did it with a prism . He split the white light to colours then let the only orange light to another prism but so he didnot find another colors segment  
20210808005	:::	 The color spectrum was explained the weakness of white light .  The light pass through the  spectrum from white / bright to blue / darkness weakness increases .    Later he purchase the prism .  He isolated the orange color and it passed it through the second prism .  Then he noticed there is no other colors existence behind the second prism .  He concluded the white color is made up other colors.

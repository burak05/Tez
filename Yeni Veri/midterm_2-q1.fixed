20180808086:::copernicus calculate all spheres revolve around the sun so the center of the universe is sun rather than part and galileo built his own telescope
20190808014:::copernicus concluded that all spheres revolve around the sun so the center of the universe is sun rather than the earth and galileo used lenses and built his own telescope and made observations including observing the moons of jupiter
20190808021:::telescopes were invented earth rotating around the sun was proved earth s one rotation around the sun was calculated as a year orbits of the planets and the moons were proved to be elliptical and thus differ from time to time
20190808034:::after copernicus break the earth is the enter of the universe kepler add more truth to copernicus with kepler rules galileo was the last touching with his telescope to observe whole universe
20190808035:::copernicus he present the heliocentric model and said that the earth is not center of the universe galileo he made a telescope and use it to observe the motion of planets
20200808003:::from copernicus to galileo the shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric model and the observation of jupiter s moons marked a transformative period in astronomy challenging traditional views and laying the groundwork for a more accurate understanding of the solar system
20200808008:::astronomers leave the idea of the geocentric model behind and start to searching evidence for heliocentric model afterwards
20200808009:::in this range can look the space by using telescope describing how the system works
20200808015:::copernicus invented the himself telescope galileo said the earth is as a circle shape idea and galileo noticed moons orbit the planet
20200808020:::copernican model galileo invented telescopes earth is not center of universe
20200808026:::the sun is the center of the solar system and planets velocity will increasing approach the sun velocity s of planets faster than the farther away
20200808028:::from copernicus to galileo the achievements in astronomy included the heliocentric model proposed by copernicus challenging the geocentric view and galileo s telescopic observations revealing jupiter s moons and supporting the heliocentric understanding of the solar system
20200808033:::galileo supported the heliocentric model proposed by copernicus with his telescope observations
20200808038:::galileo suffering to copernicus model understood that earth is not center of universe invented telescope and with invention of telescope we study more scientific on astronomy and leveled up in astronomy
20200808045:::copernicus says the earth not center of the universe the sun is center of the universe heliocentricmodel galileo says motion is independent weight the pendulum time is independent from the height invented telescope

20200808063:::galileo explained tidal motion in the copernican system of heliocentricity
20200808072:::planets orbiting around the sun and orbiting own axis copernicus to galileo achievements in astronomy
20200808080:::from copernicus to galileo important discoveries in astronomy occurred one of it that copernicus suggesting th sun at the center of the solar system not earth and galileo observe some things like jupiter moon s using telescope
20200808504:::from copernicus to galileo they put earth the center of universe from geocentric to heliocentric
20200808505:::it determined that geocentric model doesn t overlap with math so copernicus suggested heliocentric model sun is the center bruno thought that he was write and had some thoughts about other planets and intelligent beings on them tycho made lots of computes and collected data about the movement of the planets time orbit and hired kepler who used his data for his 3 laws about motion cosmic whirlpool elliptic motion galileo made his telescope in 1609 and saw craters mountains determined jupiter has 4 moons venus has phases like moon and so on
20200808805:::galileo explained tidal motion in first clear expression of his belief in the copernican system of heliocentricity
20210808005:::copernicus tought the sun at the center and he proposed that heliocentric model bruno taught copernicus was right brahe s observations was so accurate that modern telescopes largely confirmed that his measurements he collect data and his data was correct and his experiment was not correct kepler discovered that planets moves in an elliptical orbits not in the perfect circle when he did that he use brahe s data law of ellipses
20210808006:::p i d ispasted copernicus formulated a heliocentric model challenging the geocentric view kepler s laws described planetary motion galileo s telescopic observations supported heliocentrism unveiling moons around jupiter and sunspots fundamentally transforming our perception of the universe and laying the foundation for modern astronomy
20210808011:::the earth was known as the center of the universe but galileo proved that it isn t by looking at the sky with his telescope and see the moons of jupiter
20210808012:::p i d ispasted tycho brahe collected lots of big data over 30 years and data was really accurate for his time copernicus found the earth want the center of universe kepler found law of motion of planets galileo invented the telescope and he made an important experiment falling objects rule

20210808017:::kepler laws 1st one is elliptical orbit 2nd one is planets move faster copernic said it to but kepler is more accurate while they near the sun 3rd one is harmony period and distance and he found it because of tycho s observations
20210808018:::they put math in it they foun out earth is n't the center of universe change from geocentric to heliocentric they found orbits and ellipses
20210808021:::they found sun is center of the system and found telescope microscope and metremesura
20210808022:::copernicus result started scientific revolution copernicus invented copernican system galileo write a book refers to copernican and aristotelian galileo invented the first telescope copernicus did not agree geocentric model but galileo agree
20210808025:::before they thought earth is center of the universe but then they noticed sun is the center of the universe and planets were goes in elliptical orbit
20210808033:::copernicus proposed heliocentric model which means the sun is center of universe after that galileo support the idea of heliocentric model and he also invented his own telescope so he discover moons of jupiter
20210808035:::copernic use heliocentric model also explain earth has two motion then kepler prove it with tree law with his own telescope after that galileo discuss thos with two chief system and prove it
20210808038:::it stated that the earth rotates both itself and the sun also the sun is the center of the universe
20210808042:::built his own telescope for universe and discovered elliptic orbit copernicus used brahe s data
20210808044:::sun centred system heliocentric model kepler s laws elliptical law equal area law the law of harmonies elliptical orbit telescope are the achievements
20210808048:::copernicus suggested that the planets including earth orbit the sun instead of everything revolving around the earth and galileo used a telescope to confirm this idea changing how we saw the universe
20210808056:::by observing they showed us that the earth is not center of universe and also tycho used a fix start as an independent reference point to find velocity of objects and also kepler proposed elliptical motion
20210808061:::copernicus and galileo were both had conflict with the church vatican and eventhough church believed earth was center of the universe both galileo and copernicus believed that the sun is in the center of the universe and other planets orbit taking mid point as the sun
20210808062:::copernicus thought the sun is the center of universe galileo invented his own telescope
20210808065:::copernic proposed heliocentrism the sun centered solar system while galileo observed moons orbiting jupiter

20210808076:::copernicus tought the sun centre of the universe he agree with heliocentric galileo invented own telescope to see planets behaviours
20210808604:::copernicus discover earth have two movements which are own axis and around sun and also he said earth is not center of the universe also galileo said that earth is sphere and is not center of universe and he observe moon with own telescope six magnitude
20210808605:::from copernicus proposing a heliocentric solar system to galileo observing jupiter s moons the period marked a transformative shift in astronomy challenging geocentric and advancing our understanding of celestial motion
20210808610:::copernicus discovered copernicus solar system
20210808612:::copernicus estimated that part can t be center of universe because the math didn t work galileo watched the moons of jupiter and predict the same think observation

20220808001:::they invented new telescopes to observe better and they agreed on heliocentric model
20220808002:::solar system had been discovered by scientists
20220808005:::copernicus he believed that sun is the center of universe and he proposed heliocentric model galileo after galileo s invention of his telescope he noticed something the moon had craters jupiter had 4 moons the milky way was composed of hundreds of stars sun is just a star not center of universe
20220808006:::galileo invented his own telescope the ellipse path was found the moon has mountain and hill kepler found three laws understanding that the earth is not in the center of the universe
20220808007:::copernicus found out that the earth is not the center of the universe but the sun is kepler developed the laws of planetary motion galileo discovered 4 satellites revolving around the jupiter meaning they don t revolve around the earth
20220808010:::they invent their telescopes and make observation about astronomy by using mathematics and they understand the orbits orbit elliptical axis and universes mechanics
20220808013:::galileo find many different stars with her telescope and kepler find that the planets move an elliptic line
20220808014:::galileo invented the telescope
20220808016:::copernic s astronomy says earth revolving on a perfect circle path then they find out earth revolving on a ellipse path and sun is the centre of universe
20220808018:::copernicus believed there is circular orbit in universe but it wasn t true after copernicus they found out actually there is an elliptical orbit thanks to tycho brahe s data and motion in the universe also after that galileo found out his telescope he figured out heavenly bodies are not perfect because of the mountains of moon
20220808019:::copernicus told propose that earth and other planets revolve around the sun the heliocentric theory of the solar system
20220808022:::copernicus was agree with heliocentric model but then galileo s invention of telescope and observations about mars and jupiter or tycho s measurements occurred that heliocentric model was not true
20220808023:::geocentric approach were proven to be wrong and heliocentric approach were proven to be true
20220808024:::copernicus had built his own model which is copernicus model this model says about center of earth not center of the universe but only center of gravity and lunar sphere and he says earth has to have two movement one around the sun one around the own axis he says sun is center of the universe and then comes kepler he had established his own laws 1st is elliptic orbital 2nd equal area in equal time 3rd one is t2 r3 t 1 year r distance between objects lastly galileo he built his own telescope and did important observations like jupiter has 4 satellite and that means earth not the center of the universe
20220808025:::ellis orbits motions of spheres gravitational effect were discovered
20220808026:::the big part of the copernican model changed improved and many confusing situation explained from copernicus to galileo
20220808028:::in astronomy achievements raise needs in this time every scientist was attracted by before scientist s works and they improved these orbit of ellipse telescope
20220808029:::galileo made his own telescope kepler found 3 laws copernicus found that earth has 2 motions and galileo found that earth wasn t the center of universe
20220808032:::copernican solar system tycho works kepler law law of ellipses law of equal areas law of harmonies elliptiptic motion galileo telescope
20220808033:::
20220808034:::they find out that the sun is at center of the universe and planets and star orbiting the sun in an elliptical way
20220808035:::copernicus mentions heliocentric model and kepler discovered elliptic orbit and he invented 3 law of motion and galileo invented telescope
20220808037:::telescope is invented we discovered earth is not the center of universe
20220808038:::copernicus he find heliocentric model he said that earth is not the center of the universe but center of gravity and lunar sphere tycho brahe he measured over 30 years he looked a fixed star his data s were very accurate but he can not worked on his data galileo galileo worked on tycho s data and he find orbits are elliptical sun is the center earth has two motion
20220808039:::changing the center of solar system sun or earth
20220808041:::copernicus sun is the center of universe and proposed the heliocentric model tycho brahe his measurement are really accurate and but he was wrong about that the earth is the center of universe kepler he established 3 law of planets motion he determined that orbits are elliptical not circular galileo he invented own telescope and discover that celestial object not perfect and the earth is not center of universe
20220808043:::galileo improved telescope that need a help by copernicus and found the mistakes of copernicus because these are not convenient new science age
20220808044:::all the planets rotate in the sun s orbit which is the center and the motions of firmamation apparent retrograde and what seems like the motion of the sun is caused by the earth s motions not the sun s
20220808045:::in this era they found the more accurate theory heliocentric rather than geocentric that defined the planets movements in the ellipse way their movements results about the sweep out equal areas and their periods and distances more correctly
20220808046:::copernic s astronomy says earth rejoining on a perfect circle than they says rejoining on a ellipse
20220808047:::copernicus thought sun and other planets has circle orbit but kepler said there are ellipse orbits and he invented 3 laws hooke said day light have one colour but after newton found an isolated color not have another color but white color have all of colors and galileo invented telescope people can see a ship 2 hour earlier before came with telescope
20220808048:::for copernicus sun was in the center of the universe is heliocentric not geocentric sun is in the center of the universe velocity changes constantly the area that a planet
20220808050:::
20220808051:::he observed four moos in straight line orbiting the jupiter
20220808052:::telescope found and heavenly bodies now can be seen closer
20220808053:::there is no just one center of the universe every planets move around sun and its axis for example moon is orbiting around earth
20220808055:::copernicus he did heliocentric model and he explain earth s two movement his system was not elliptical tycho brahe he did lots of observation for long time with great patient collect very big data he observed the stars during for 6 month and he decided earth is stationary kepler he realized tycho s data was not suitable for circle orbit but suitable for elliptical orbit and he explain his works with three laws the law of elliptical same areas and harmonies galileo he did some observations with his telescope and he realized that jupiter has 4 satellites so geocentric model was wrong
20220808056:::scientific revolution because they learned nothing is center of universe even earth and that changed everything
20220808057:::copernic found heliocentric model like sun is center of solar system and galileo found telescope and draw moon surface
20220808058:::as the main change we got the instruments which made it easier to observe sky so we got much more data to analyze
20220808059:::sun is the center of the universe and other planets are rounding around the sun with elliptic movement before that they are believing earth is the center of the universe but it s wrong
20220808060:::
20220808062:::earth has 2 movements
20220808063:::firmly copernicus discovered that closer objects circle faster around the sun the the farther ones and earth is not centre of universe then kepler discovered that the planets did not rotate in a circular pattern rotate elliptical also if we drawn imagine line between the centre of earth and sun the line sweep out the same area in equal periods of time
20220808066:::universe does n't fit geocentric model it should be heliocentric model planets areorbiting the sun in a path described an ellipses a planet moves fastest when it is closest to the sun and slowest when it is furthest from the sun but as a result of this station if an imagery line were drawn from planet to sun this swear out same area in equal periods
20220808067:::copernicus have a three laws first they realize the planets are not go with perfect circle ways they go with elliptic ways second there is a rule that in equal times equal areas in planet and there is a rule named period rules period of satellites depends on their radius lastly they realize the velocity of orbits are depended on radius
20220808069:::copernicus did heliocentric model he thought there is no center at the universe the planets tycho brahe did long time observation collect big data and his data were high quality he thought earth was stationary kepler used tycho s data and he invented law of planetary motion he thought tycho was not right no circle motion elliptical motion galileo discovered telescope and had developed spy glasses he did observation with inclined he discovered 4 satellites for saturn
20220808070:::copernicus described the heliocentric theory of solar system earth and planets revolve around the sun
20220808071:::they explain solar system center of universe the earth s around the sun and around the axis
20220808072:::copernicus said the earth had two movements one of them is rotating around the sun and the other on is rotting its axis galileo developed spy glasses and developed own telescope to observe the moon and jupiter
20220808073:::with copernic sun is the center of universe with kepler planets around in elliptical path surround of sun and planets velocity changes in different time there is a new heliocentric system new relation of planets law of physics and there is revolution in science from geometry based system to mechanic system now we can understand act dropped ball and we can understand nature with mathematic language and also we can observe far away bodies with new telescopes and explain how the universe work
20220808074:::they made modern instrument such as galileo telescope and they observed sky then they calculated distance between planets and other unknown things
20220808076:::with galileo invention telescope they realize there are writers and mountains in moon and they can make more certain measurements
20220808077:::copernicus said earth and other planets revolve around sun but galileo said earth is not stationary sun revolves around earth and other planets revolves around sun also he identificated mountains on moon moons of jupiter and rings of saturn
20220808504:::copernicus formulated the heliocentric model kepler discovered the laws of motion and galileo observed moons orbiting jupiter
20220808604:::copernic concluded earth has two moments one of them around the sun the other is its axis also he explained that sun is central of universe and he said that the earth is not center of universe
20220808606:::copernicus noticed that geocentric model is not right and suggested heliocentric model at first after that galileo made his own telescope and observed space he tried to explain astronomical movements
20220808607:::copernicus wasn t able to calculate the elliptic motion later on it was found by kepler with thyco s observations and also galileo made telescope so he could look at the sky to see more detailed version of the space
20220808608:::usage of the telescope and discovery of the moons of jupiter
20220808610:::invention of telescope galileo invented a reflective telescope using two mirrors called primary and secondary mirror so he could examine celestial objects earth s motion copernicus concluded that earth has two motions one around the sun and other one around it s own axis explanation of tidal motion git - gel finding the weight of the earth by using gravitational formulas
20220808616:::first copernicus thought that the earth was moving around the sun after that tycho brahe made very precise measurements but he did not achieve to use the data he gathered brahe also thought that earth is stationary then his assistant kepler found that earth and other planets moves about the sun with an elliptical orbits galileo observed the sky by using telescope and concluded heliocentric model was true
20220808617:::center of spheres is not earth it is sun and it was observed by telescopes and there were lots of mathematical calculations
20220808703:::copernicus proposed the heliocentric model sun at the center of the solar system galileo s telescopic observations provided evidence supporting this heliocentric view revolutionizing our understanding of the cosmos
20220808705:::copernicus according to the earth had to move two moment solar system all spheres midpoint turns around the sun so the sun is the center of the universe galileo determined motion is not independent of weight galileo build his own telescope
20220808706:::the heliocentric sun centered system has been defended and proven
20230808004:::copernicus claim earth has two movements first moves around the sun and second moves around its axis galileo invented his own telescope and he observed the celestial body also galileo invented his own telescope but he did not know the optics rule about telescope
20230808010:::copernicus developed heliocentric model tycho brahe made accurate measurements kepler published 3 laws of planetary motion newton formularized universal gravitation and galileo invented his own telescope
20230808020:::copernicus said the earth is orbiting its own axis also orbiting the sun galileo observed heavenly body with his own telescope
20230808049:::copernicus estimated that earth can t be the center of universe because the math didn t work but in an incomplete way galileo watched the moons of jupiter and predicted the same thing which means that astronomy was becoming a systematic science and also the center of solar system was sun
20230808055:::geocentric model replaced with heliocentric model
20230808061:::moons have orbits around the planets and we discover the orbits are not circular they are ellipse
20230808062:::copernicus and galileo both didn t agree with aristotle hence they both thought sun is the center they both believed heliocentric model also galileo invented telescope and saw that there are other planets have their own satellites so earth is not the center and turn around itself and sun
20230808066:::galileo used his telescope and it was noticed that the earth was not the center of the universe the sun was at the center and the planets were orbiting around it in elliptical shapes
20230808070:::copernicus explained that the center of the universe is sun and then kepler found that planets orbits are elliptical galileo studied about these topics and made a telescope when he searched planets with his telescope he found that copernicus was right and explained all his works with mathematical descriptions
20230808075:::copernicus claimed there is no one center of the circles and closer circles faster around bruno agreed copernicus and claimed sun is just a star and there are millions of planets with intelligence beings tycho patiently and systematically accurately observed for 30 years and said earth is stationary and he calculated velocity of bodies by observing fixed stars galileo built refracting telescopes to observe more accurately found out jupiter s moons
20230808077:::earth is turning around itself and sun and sun is center of the universe and sun is just a star there are a lot of planets and galileo built his own telescope
20230808602:::copernicus thought the orbits are circular galileo said it is elliptical
20230808608:::from copernicus to galileo our astronomy theories changed drastically basically how we think our planet and other planets changed we thought other planets revolved around the earth but that was not the case and they revolved around the sun
20230808609:::copernicus and galileo both said that the earth is not the center of the universe the sun is the center of the universe heliocentric model earth is just center of the gravity and moon s orbit also galileo made a telescope and observed the jupiter moon and the sun also kepler found 3 laws
20230808611:::galileo built his own telescope for universe and he measurement acceleration fo a object and copernicus used brahe s data and discovered elliptic orbit
20230808613:::we discovered and improved the orbital movement of the sun centered system also we figured out how sun centered system works
20230808615:::heliocentric model accepted geocentric refused moon criteria valleys mountains discovered jupiter moons discovered orbits of planets discovered as ellipses
20230808617:::it is realized that the earth isn t the center of the universe planets go around their own axis and planets have their moon that goes around its orbit
20230808618:::galileo has some idea about astronomy some of them is true but copernicus explain everything correctly and explain some laws about astronomy like when a planet close it start move faster and when it far it is start move slowly also he said planet moves in a elliptic road and when he observation venus he realize that because calculate of galileo it have to 8 minutes but venus move in 4 minutes
20230808621:::copernicus he said that earth is have more than one movements and the earth is not center of the universe the sun is the center of universe tycho he declare the velocity of body he found one star and observe it from time to time with location kepler he used the tycho s data and found that their data does not fit the circular shape it has to be fit to ellipse and he claim that when de planets closer the sun they will be faster and when the further away from the sun they will be lover galileo he discover that falling object s time is not decent the weight also he discovered the time of swing pendulum not decent on the height and he built his own telescope
20230808623:::we have managed to explore that earth is not the center of the universe and it has a elliptic orbit around the sun like other planets

20190808021	:::	 The first step is figuring out why there is a contradiction. Is your own hypothesis wrong or is the known fact faulty itself? Thus to prove if your hypothesis is correct or not, you should find evidence supporting your hypothesis.   After you find evidence, the next step is seeing if it proves your hypothesis or disproves it. If you can prove your thoughts, the contradiction is because the known fact itself is wrong and you've found the correct answer. Alternatively if the evidence supports the already known fact, then your hypothesis is wrong. In that case a new hypothesis can be made.

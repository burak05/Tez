20180808086	:::	 Romans achievements are in a Modern Goverment. Consult,senate and Assemblies. the other achievements about science,enginnering is Romans archs,Newspaper, The 12 table, julian Calander, Concrete.   They differ from Greeks; Greeks was having great open air setting and allowed everyone watch.And greeks are achievements Democrasy.  
20190808014	:::	 Romans advanced in modern legal system, civil engineering, military engineering and more like gregorian calendar. They also divided powers, known as the divison of the powers. There were 3 parties: Conculs, Senates and Assemblies. I also must mention about conflict of interests, I can give that example: Senators were forbidden to make trade, because they would use their influences over their personal gains of trading. They differ in terms of theaters, while Greeks was having great open-air settings, and allowed everyone to watch, and were about mostly tales, gods, love etc, Romanian theater was more about personal stories, closed and realistic shows. Greeks also acted with maskes sometimes. And theater haved influence over democracy.  
20190808021	:::	 The ten main achievements of romans were the battlefield surgeries, bound books, the 12 tables, the julian calendar, aqueducts, roman bridges, roads and highways, newspapers, welfares and concrete.   The Greeks were mostly working on mathematical, philosophical and astronomical improvements. While the Romans worked on military, building and law improvements. Thus we can say Greeks were more of a thinker while Romans were more of a builder.   
20190808035	:::	 Roads and highways   using geometry   military engineering   they use the science to make changes in their life  
20200808003	:::	
20200808008	:::	 Romans achieved civil and army engineering, rebuplic government system, fundamentals of modern legal systems, a road and trade web all across the europe, they rule Medittarenean for hundereds of years. Greeks are seeking for answers to questions about nature, they are developing theories and philosophies but Romans did not developed them. Romans used what science and philosophy they already have and improved their tools, armies, cities, laws and goverment system that divise the power of rulars.  
20200808015	:::	 Romans contribute with about law achievements to the World.They differ from Greeks ,their rules are more strict than the Greeks.  
20200808020	:::	 Romans are great at war and governent.   They didn't choose a king. They choose consuls, senato and assemblies instead of a one king.   They made roads and highways. That roads made their economy great.   They had Twelve Table (set of laws).   They invented newspaper, Romans achers, Julien Calendar...   Difference from the Greeks;   Greeks were used science for understand to nature not as a tool. Greeks thought about more philosophy.    Romans were trough governent.  
20200808026	:::	 The Romans are good at engineering than Greeks. They are not predictable that Greeks are. They are improving some invention that can using practical information. They improve themself about military. They invented Romans arches.   
20200808033	:::	 - From theater pov : Ancient Greece was like birhplace of theater and mostly focused on mythologiacl and ethical themes, roman theater is influced by greek theater and it was mostl focused on comedy and drama.   - From political pov : Ancient Greece had city-state system and every state had its own govarnance while Romans had monarchy to a republic and it becamed to an Empire after that because they had military and engineering discipline.   - From Cultural Discipline : They contributed to he philosophy, democracy, mythology, while Romans contributed to the law, engineering, architecture, military  
20200808038	:::	 some of Romans achievements : Battlefield surgery,Twelve Tables,Newspaper,Julian Calendar   Greeks approach to science differently, They used science not only as a practical tool also explain nature.No coherent theory until Greeks.   Romans usually worked on Legal Systems,Government but Greeks better than Romans about philosophy or astronomy.  
20200808045	:::	 The romans wants to biggest empire in the world  . so use the science different from greeks .for example  romans developed highways and roads battelfield surgery .The greeks  use the science for understand and predict the nature I think this işs the main difference .  
20200808062	:::	 The roads is the most important achievement of Romans that make differ between Romans and the Greeks. It make a differ because the roads make the army much faster to travel. And it also help the economy by making faster the travel for traders.      
20200808063	:::	 Greeks theaters different from the romans and they argued for the theaters.  
20200808072	:::	 romans 3 kind of governments. consuls , senote , assimblie . romans theater about comedy, greeks theater about religion and myth.       
20200808504	:::	 Some of the achievements of Romans are Theatre . They differ from Greeks Roman's Theatre judge government. People loves that topics. İt is no drama, it is realistic problems.

20210808014	:::	 they improved social engineering. Theatre, laws, social language (translators). The difference of theatre is roman theatre made people critique about politics.  
20210808016	:::	 Greeks used observation to support their theories.no theories just observation but roma doesn't like that and Greeks used science not only as a practical tool but also to explain nature  
20210808017	:::	 Actually Romans were different from Greeks but although they a bit similar to the Greeks.For example Roman theater and Greeks theater were a verry different to each other such as in Roman theather had a seating arrangement and people were sitting accordingly to their social status but in Greeks theater everyone could sit wherever they want also Romans played theather for entartainment but Greeks used the teather for instilled a democracy ideology to their people so Greeks theather was a bit of political but Romans theather was a mostly entartaining places.Also Romans invented a new tihng like newspaper.  
20210808018	:::	 they had different theaters   
20210808021	:::	 Romans used science for medicine , military and tool but Greeks used science not only tool, they also used science to explain nauture    Romans calculeted the how much days are there in year and they found the days in mouth   Romans produced the tool for medicine       
20210808022	:::	 greeks wanted strictly deductive proofs based on stated axioms. Greeks thought systematiclly ( systematic ). Romans made a science for military. Romans donot made a science for science but greeks made it. Romans invented newspaper , roads , concrete , bound books , roman arches , welfare. greeks theater had public and no concept of protocol but romans theater had concept of protocol and no public. Romans used Julian calendar greeks didnot use  
20210808025	:::	 They use practical tools and they do observation and predict. Romans has some of achievements differents Greeks. They use Power of Division. It means power is not just have emperor. There are part of 3 different groups. Those are consuls, seneto and assimblies. Consuls choosen by government.There are 2 people in consuls. They can vote each other. Which person in seneto can't trade and engage in bank. This is conflict of inflict.   
20210808033	:::	 romans were used bang to the world roman government had to division of power. thats how they differ from Greeks. they also had to the first conduction even thought they are new.   also they invented the Julian calendar.      
20210808035	:::	 romans made modern government with consuls ,senate and assembly and they are better at civil engineering and military engineering and they made good highways and roads to have good connection in their empire  
20210808038	:::	 Romans achieved the democracy. they ended monarchy and bring representative by using the division of the power. In this system, the power were the people. They had right to vote .   Romans had the stated legal system. they used 12 tablets. each had the laws to how to take actions for crimes.   Romans develop the julian and later gregorian calendar. They were pretty accurate compare to what greeks used.   To sum up, romans biggest achievements was legal and goverment system. greeks were the science.  
20210808042	:::	 One of the achievements is legal law for democracy.   The others:   The twelve table   The concenter   Newspaper  
20210808044	:::	 They gained the democracy, and they were successful. Because they divided to 3 part the power:Consule,Senato and assemblies. They used the science for technology and they used the technology for military, but Greeks used the science for understand the nature.  
20210808048	:::	 Romans excellent at road,calender and laws.They used conflict of interest , so they avoid monarchy.Greeks wanted strinctly deductive way based on axioms. otherwise romans did not.  
20210808056	:::	 Romans took care of civil engineering and military engineering to improve tecnologhy. They created highways, big cities...   Romans had division of power : consule , senate , assemblies.   Romans'  justice system was orderly and strict.   They established 12 Tables rules.  
20210808061	:::	 They established calendar.   They established Modern Legal System.   They had good travel roadways and highways. They had good travel network.   They grew their economy.    Greeks used science not only as a pratical tool but to understand and explain the nature.

20210808604	:::	 Romans achievements are aquaducks, civil engineering, military engineering, highways. romans want to solve their problems espacially about war, but greeks want to finding mean  
20210808605	:::	 The Romans made significant contributions to various fields, including ; engineering and architecture, law and governance , military , language , infrastructure. Comparing them to the Greeks , there are key differences; philosophy , art and culture , government , science and math. Shortly, both civilizations left lasting legacies but the Greeks are often associated with philosophy and art while the Romans are renowned for their engineering , law and governance.  
20210808608	:::	 One of the achievemnts from Romans differ from the Greeks is the Power of Division. It includes Counselars, Senate and Assemblers. Because of that system country can be ruled more objective.  
20210808610	:::	
20210808612	:::	 romans made roads and highways, butterfield surgery, twelve tables, julian calender but greeks search universe for example; moon, earth    greeks  calculate the distance between the Earth and Moon.

20210808616	:::	 Achievements of the Romans: Engineering , agrıculture and military   The Romans and the Greeks made significant contributions to the development of Western civilization,  
20220808001	:::	 First of all they were better at military engineering.Because of that they improved their science a lot.They made big highways to deploy army quicker but it was also good for trading.   They had better government system. They have rules and everyone shouldn't do something against rules,if they to they will be punished.  
20220808002	:::	 Their theatre shows had closed to public.  
20220808005	:::	 Government and society, for example the theatres are public in Romans unless Greeks. Military in Romans is strong, but Greeks are not as strong. Romans has large empire than the Greeks. Studying is more practical in Romans because they generally use in military, but Greeks are more theoretical than Romans.  
20220808006	:::	 Romans were good at military and civil engineering. They established highways and roads. They were interested in technology.  Also they created modern laws system. This is differnet from Greeks because The Romans were the first republic. And also in Greeks, science was important but in Romans technology was important, and they used science as a tool.  
20220808007	:::	 Romans were first to bring Republic to the world. They also had the first constitution, even though it was simple, writing the rules known by previous civilizations down.  
20220808010	:::	 romans law is really different from greeks. because greeks are always udnerstand and predict science and nature but romans are also developed their law,    romans did legal system,    cructure. romans highways and structers are different from greeks,  
20220808013	:::	 Some of their achievements are Julian calendar . Their difference is they work about science but also engineering.  
20220808014	:::	 They build new highways to trade their products .Because they want to do it easier.   They used more developed laws to judge people.   
20220808016	:::	 they invented roads (primitve highways).   they invented 12 tablets.   they made a cure for conflict of interest through making consuler, assemblies, senato.      
20220808018	:::	 Some of the inventions that Romans found:    Newspaper      Concrete     Julian (Julius) Calendar      The twelve tables      Roman arches      Welfare   The biggest difference between greeks and romans is policity and democracy. The greeks suffered because of trying to take representative ways and not succeed. But the romans did.  
20220808019	:::	     
20220808022	:::	 Julian Calendar, division of power, theatre, Gregorian Calender   They divided the power and menaged the empire with consuls,essamblies and senate.  
20220808023	:::	 Some achievement of romans does include Julian Calendar, Battlefield medicine, military system, written laws and division of power. Greek's were on more science and philoshophy while Rome focused on things like ruling mechanism and military advancements so scientific progress was little.  
20220808024	:::	 Romans did efficient travel network, Jullian calendar, news paper, battlefield surgery. Difference between them is romans are more military type and Romans have roman legal system , Law for everyone even for ruler.  
20220808025	:::	 Romans built highways collesiums and several architecture places. Romans lived long years but greeks could not live like that. Because Romans were more democratic and more fair. Its most effective differ I think.  
20220808026	:::	     the military were very important for the roman people constructed roads to roman legions to be rapidly deployed    but we can not say military were important for the greeks        romans had travel network throughout the empire and this situation dramitaclly increased the Rome's influence and power    but for greek we can not say that .           
20220808028	:::	 Because,roma has a vast and efiicient travel network and roma was affected from other culture.In thıs because,roma has more ımproving than greeks.  
20220808029	:::	 The contributions of Greece and Rome in philosophy and religion, political and legal institutions, poetry and drama. So this means that Greeks were more open-minded but Romans were religious and they didn't questioned what they know.  
20220808032	:::	 Greeks asked a questions for science but Romans interested in laws.Romans are some rules in law.Its called Division of power.Greeks have so many philosophers.Romans interested in government things.  
20220808033	:::	
20220808034	:::	 They were good at law. They established 12 Tablets. Romans are different Greeks because Greeks used science not only explain the nature.  
20220808035	:::	 They invented twelve Tables so changed to rules of law and they introduced lawyer term.   They made roads and highways.   In Romans time, there didn't happend conflict of interest.   They changed the power of judgment. Like consuls, senate and assembiles. Because before Romans, just king had power of judgment. Just he Judged everyone so he judged whatever he want. However, after the Romans, goverment had power of judgment so there wasn't any wrong decitions.  
20220808037	:::	 Romans have invented newspaper, roads and highways, bound books, Julian calendars. The base difference between Romans and Greeks is Greeks developed the science and Romans used the sciences that the Greeks developed to develop their technology.  
20220808038	:::	 They made The Legal System for improving the judgment. Also, there were division of power which is important for government. They did the first roads and highways for military. Today there is important quote for this situation 'All roads come to Roma'. Also they used newspaper for reach population. They were different from Greeks in theatre. Theatre was for everyone in Romans but in Greeks theatre was just for government.   
20220808039	:::	 Romans are known to built highways, roads, arches and tend to expand. On the other hand, Greeks worked on science and philosophy more than Romans.    Romans used cement, built arches and published newspapers.   
20220808041	:::	 They made The Legal System to make law with system.   Also they had the idea called &quot;The Division of Power&quot; .So There were 3 part instead of king.These are consuls,senato and assemblies.   There were theatre in Rome and Greeks but they were different.For ınstance Roman's theatre were public and there was no protochol system.However, in Greeks theatre wasnt public.   Also romans are one of the first republic.The population who voting had power.  
20220808043	:::	 Roman people worked about science far away from mithology. These progressings based on law system. Senate, consuls and these like proggresings used age of Romans.   
20220808044	:::	 Romans introduced modern law notions, built roads and highways, introduced 12 tables of law. They invented Julian calender, newspaper, concerete, Roman archs, bound books, battlefield surgery, welfare. They were engineers. Greeks were interested in finding out rational answers to questions through science. They had a systematic approach. They did not see it as a tool for practical use but tried to understand, predict and make observations. Romans used it for engineering purposes.  
20220808045	:::	 Romans Walls and Highways: The highways involved them a network and trade area.   Romans Law: They developed a legal system.   Cructure: They could built structures from this invent.      
20220808046	:::	 they made roads and highway.   they made newspaper.   supplement 1 and supplement 2.   they describe nature with science.   they used practice for science.      
20220808047	:::	 the court or justice came first to greeks. Greeks can make a discover and they can discus between their own self. but Romans can't do it because of their courts. So lots of product or theory rejected by court. Additionally court was very frightening because of killing science men. Greeks was more free and peaceful. they has lots of time for thinking, science...  
20220808048	:::	 They had law system of their own. Romans used different calender system and corrected the old calenders. (leap year by every 100 years)      
20220808050	:::	 Greeks never accept as it is, they always think  
20220808051	:::	 Calendar, Romans are improved calendar.Greeks used basic calendars unlike Romans.Also Romans invented 3 different calendar.Nowadays we are using the same one of them   Battlefield Surgery, Romans invented new tools about medicine.   Roman Aqueduts,Roman's population was increasing.So they need more water.So that they built aqueduts,Greeks didnt use or build any aqueduts.   Roads,Roman's population was increasing.And they used huge places.So that Romans improved their roads.Population and lenght of roads is main difference.   Newspaper,Romans wanted to record daily actions.So that they made a newspaper by using tablets or rocks.      
20220808052	:::	 <span style="font-size: 24px;">Aqueducts,Roman Roads,Roman Law and Concrete is one of their contribution of Romans. Aqueducts is network for water transportation, There is a famous say ' All roads leads to Rome'. That is because of genius engineering of layered roads.They used roads for military and trade.Their legal system still used as foundation for modern legal procedures like jury, lawyer and prisons. Lastly their method of concrete making is very expert level even considering today's standard. They differ from Greeks because they used science for military purposes. Unlike Romans, Greeks used science purely to explain and predict the nature.</span>  
20220808053	:::	 Romans made aqua way, big roads, battle surgery, concrete, especially in army.   Romans and Greeks had kind a law system but it did not work in ancient greeks but this system worked in Rome.  
20220808055	:::	 Romans have many achievements; like 12 table (like a small constitution). Julian calendar (12 months and each has 30 days), highways (built for military but after used for economy), newspaper (reaching people). They have different modern legal system from Greeks. They have division of power. Romans theaters were different form Greeks. At Romans audiences were sitting more randomly at the theaters and Greeks used masks for actors but Romans theatre was more realistic.  
20220808056	:::	 they used theater as influence people not justfor entertainment. theyb influenced by their theater soldier and tradement systems.they have a law system  
20220808057	:::	 Romans are better structure and military system  than Greeks . They create 12 tables and 10 innovations . Only chosen people watch theatre but all Greek people watch theatre.   
20220808058	:::	 Ancient Greeks used observation and theories to explain the nature but they weren't good at engineering at all (they made technological contribution to civilization of humanity of course) but definitely we can't say that their prominent quality was this. Romans were quite advanced in engineering, they constructed  water Arches, made diches. Also another important quality of them was about constructing highways and roads - which was created for military purposes at first but then came important in commerce). Republic concept was used by them differ from Ancient Greeks. Actually both of them was democratic countries but Romans differs itself from Greeks by being a Republic.  
20220808059	:::	 Romans are good in Civil and Military Engineering.  Romans made the roads for their Legions, but these roads become an important economic power for Romans. Every road exits the Rome. Romans made a Modern Judgment System, but Greeks didn't make.    
20220808060	:::	 Expanding the  Empire's transport network boosted the Empire's authority and impact.They had 12 Table Laws.Everyone has to understand 12 Table Laws even king.  
20220808062	:::	 they used science for the understand nature, used observation and prediction, learned the proofs that stated axioms.

20220808066	:::	 roman roads , aquaduets, concrete  , roman law    there was not one director , there was 3 people instead of  one director  like senato conculs and people would choose to them .   roman roads are made for military .   concrete  are invented for building instrecture.              
20220808067	:::	  For Romans science is just practical tool. They use science for creating some  usefull for him. They make concrete newspaper. Greeks are systematic and observation. Greeks try to explain nature and make deductions for it. Then try to prove their theory and deduction. They are rolativist and cumulative.  
20220808069	:::	 Engineering and agriculture.Philosophy and religion. Poetry and drama. Arches. Roads and highways. Bound book.   Their theatre is based on fun but Greek theathre is based on reach to people for science and relieve anxiety and knowledge.    The Greeks were democratic while the Romans were a republic.      
20220808071	:::	 They achieved good at the agriculture and cinematics of science   differ : cumulative,prograssive  
20220808072	:::	 In romans there was very improved civil and military engineering. And romans had efficient roads so it provide being center of the trade.  
20220808073	:::	 Some of their achievements are aqueducts , news paper , bond books , roads and highways , the twelve tables . the difference is that after Greeks romans ended progress in science. they paid attention to be the best in civil engineering and military engineering to protect their empire.  
20220808074	:::	 romans very good at civil and military engineering . they had enormous economics highways.they used roads for trade. the greeks used the science not as a practical tool . they strictly deductive proof basde on stated axioms they made observation they have theory but romans did not have theory . they just looking nature and they things that it is happened like that.  
20220808076	:::	 FİRSTLY CALENDAR ROMANS İMPROVE JULİAN CALENDAR AND GREGORİUS CALENDAR. SECONDLY THEY BUİLD LOTS OF HİGHWAY AND THEY MADE 12 TABLE .   
20220808077	:::	 They improved medicine better. Put on things which greeks found. The roads of rome are various unlike greece, The idiom of &quot;All roads leads to rome&quot; comes from this. There are some roman months differ from greece.  
20220808504	:::	 Some of Roman innovations are concrete, newspaper, bound boks, Julian calendar and their differ ıs Romans worked about science far away from methods. Theır progress based on law system.

20220808604	:::	 Romans are better than Greeks . First example ,their law system has power of division.They have consule,senato and assembilies.Also the other example is millitary.Their millitary was perfectlier than Greeks because they care about to millitary spending.  
20220808606	:::	 For Romans it was important to make science universal and continuing.  
20220808607	:::	 they made julies calender , they made roads for military deployement,  and the difference between greeks and romans was they were more democratic and had law enforcements and used science to improve on military things but the greeks used science to observe nature and understand it.  
20220808608	:::	 agriculture cumulative progressive abstraction predict  
20220808610	:::	 Their most important achievements are; roads, highways, arches, concrete, Julien calendar. They were also better than greeks on civil engineering and military engineering. They made roads and highways which lead to economical power in the world. There is a saying as &quot;All roads leads to Rome&quot;.  
20220808616	:::	 Romans used science as only a practical tool and that resulted them to improve in only technological and engineering fields, they do not have much contribution in science. One of their contribution in technology is that catapults those can throw a huge rock to enemy ships, most of Roman's inventions came from military motivation. On the other hand, Greeks wanted to show and prove the knowledge that they knew practically and they used modeling and maths for it. They wanted to see strictly deductive proofs for axioms to understand it clearly, they tried to develope different approaches in scientific works.  
20220808617	:::	 Julian Callender , roads and highways , newspaper , twelwe tables.  They made roads and highways for legions. Thanks to these achievements they increase themselves fast. Also they manage the Roman with division of interest. What I mean there are consults, senates and asemblers. So, in this system civilians can make a choise who manage themselves.   
20220808703	:::	 for military and then trade made of roads and highways   military and state power    legal laws   democracy (senate, consuls and assemblies)      
20220808705	:::	 -They use division of power.   for division of power they use consule senato and assemblies.and concept of that is lawyer,jury and prison .   in roma theater is not open the public unlike greek.   in roma theater made cllasification   in roma theater there was sitting arregment   military enginering    in romans theater entirtainment    in greek theater political

20230808004	:::	 Greeks used observation support their theories and explain the nature, but they are not good at engineering and democratically things. Romans builds some network ways and also, they developed the legal system they have consul senate and assemblies consul make decision about military and political events. Senate forbidden engage banking and foreign trade.   assemblies have power to pass law They are representatives of people to some extend.   
20230808010	:::	 Romans were more focused on expanding, military and building roads/highways. Greeks were more focused on science and philosophy. Romans used cement, built arches and published newspapers while Greeks only had books in schools and didn't have advanced buildings.  In Teather Greeks thought it was religious and important, since it was close with democracy, but Romans used it differently.

20180808086:::moons would not orbit the planet but galileo observed this and concluded
20190808014:::bodies should have travel at a straight line unless a force act upon a direction moons would not orbit the planet but they did galileo observed this and he concluded weight of the planet affected them also he concluded that the motion is independent of the weight
20190808021:::he deduced that since the moons orbit the planet instead of being singed into the void jupiter must have an effect on the moons causing them to stay in orbit from there he hypothesized that jupiter s gravity keeps the moons in orbit
20190808034:::he find out everything has own center
20190808035:::the sun is not center of universe
20200808003:::jupiter had 4 moons orbiting it in an equatorial plane the milky was composed of 100 s of unknown stars venus had phases just like the moon galileo had further developed spy glasses and developed telescope where he could see moon and jupiter galileo deduced that the observation of moons orbiting jupiter supported the idea that not all celestial bodies revolved around the earth challenging the geocentric model and providing evidence for the heliocentric model proposed by copernicus
20200808008:::most of the former science and scientists believed that earth is the center of universe and every other heavenly objects orbiting the earth but when he noticed moons of jupiter he deduced the earth is not the center of universe also there might be the earth is orbiting the sun
20200808009:::
20200808015:::observing the moons of the jupiter galileo deduced when he noticed moons orbit the planet
20200808020:::galileo observe the moons of jupiter he discovered four largest moons of jupiter he build telescope and find out these moons moving around jupiter in regular orbits
20200808026:::
20200808028:::galileo s observations of jupiter s moons played a crucial role in the scientific revolution by providing observational evidence that supported the heliocentric model of the solar system this in turn had profound implications for our understanding of the structure of the universe and the relationships between celestial bodies
20200808033:::he got some evidence that the geocentric model was not correct because he realized that some objects can revolve around a planet other than the earth he started to believe in the accuracy of the heliocentric model himself
20200808038:::galileo built his own telescope and discovered jupiter s moons and sunspot and saw that there is mountains and craters on moon so recognized that celestial bodies should not be perfect while looking jupiter s moons he recognized that moons orbiting around by jupiter so there should be force for this and understood that in universe every object attracts each other the other objects in universe actually we can say that galileo discovered relationship between satellites and planets
20200808045:::
20200808062:::he understand the earth is not the center of the universe it was just an other planet like jupiter and these aren t stars these are the moons of the jupiter
20200808063:::he noticed that heavenly bodies are not perfect
20200808072:::observing the moons of the jupiter geocentric solar system galileo deduced when he noticed moons orbit the planet solar system
20200808080:::he realized that their orbits around the planet contradicted the earth - centered view of the universe against to conventional belief of his time
20200808504:::observing the moons of the jupiter galileo deduced his own telescope when he noticed moons orbit the planet independent of weight
20200808505:::orbital motion other planets has moons like earth has moon they move around it because planets are bigger for example sun is bigger so other planets rotate around it
20200808805:::he concluded that the universe is continue from orbit circles
20210808005:::galileo discovered spy glasses and telescopes where he could see moon and jupiter he noticed that the heavenly bodies are not perfect
20210808006:::p i d ispasted observing jupiter s four moons galileo disputed the geocentric model as their orbits around jupiter contradicted the earth - centric view furthermore he noted imperfections in heavenly bodies such as mountains on the moon challenging the prevailing belief in celestial perfection
20210808011:::he deduced that the earth is not the center of the universe the earth is just another planet
20210808012:::he realized if a moon circle around jupiter earth should n't be center of the universe because earth also can be circle around something
20210808014:::
20210808016:::galileo deduce that celestial body could orbit objects other than earth challenging the model his observations provided crucial evidence for the another model supporting the idea that planets revolved around the sun
20210808017:::jupiter have a 4 moons orbit so he deduced 1 planet can have moon orbit bigger than 1 he discover other planets can have a moon orbit like earth he use his own homemade telescope for this observations
20210808018:::galileo observed moons after inventing telescope he noticed moons spins by jupiters gravity through orbits
20210808021:::galileo observed the motion of pendulums the time of one swing is independent on weight
20210808022:::galileo invented the telescope and improve it he noticed the moon did not perfect galileo geocentric model orbital motion they more around it because moon very closest galileo write a book he refers to aristotelian and copernican
20210808025:::he said there are 4 moons around the jupiter
20210808033:::galileo deduced that the observed moons orbiting jupiter provided evidence supporting the heliocentric model challenging the geocentric view and suggesting celestial bodies could orbit something other than earth
20210808035:::galileo observed the motion of pendulums the time of one swing is independent of height from the pendulums started to swing galileo discovered that the period of swing of pendulums is approximately same for different sized of swings
20210808038:::the moon have their own orbit and they rotate that path constantly
20210808042:::ellipses elliptic orbit heliocentric perfect circle
20210808044:::
20210808048:::galileo thought they were stars galileo saw with telescope their positions changed on a nightly basis galileo soon recognized that these new objects were moons of jupiter
20210808056:::any bodies in the universe attract each other with a attracting force and all of bodies have own gravity galileo noticed that jupiter s gravity attracts moons this gravity causes moons orbit to curve
20210808061:::galileo determined that motion is independent of the weight galileo explained tidal motion and he believed copernicus solar system model and he thought there must be a force on planets
20210808062:::galileo invented his own telescope to view other astronomic events
20210808065:::
20210808066:::he found out orbit the jupiter moves in a elliptical pattern
20210808076:::galileo invented own telescope to review planets behaviours
20210808604:::he discover that some celestial objects turn around other celestial objects earth also have moon but jupiter have four moons and size is much bigger than earth so he think that earth can not be center of universe earth can be turn around of other celestial object
20210808605:::galileo deduced that the moons orbiting jupiter observed through his telescope supported the heliocentric model questioned the belief in geocentric
20210808610:::he realized that in fact the moons were not in a round orbit but in an elliptical motion
20210808612:::galileo observation the jupiter like this he looked at the moons and jupiter and said that the eclipse of those moons didn t go as predict sometimes it ended early and sometimes it ended late he thought that when the earth and jupiter were orbiting the sun they were some points close
20210808614:::the four galleon moons were the first celestial bodies to be discovered with a telescope although galileo at first thought they were fixed stars his continued observations showed that their positions changed on a nightly basis galileo soon recognized that these new objects were satellites of jupiter
20210808615:::galileo correctly concluded that they were not stars at all but moons orbiting around jupiter providing strong evidence for the copernican theory that most celestial objects did not revolve around the earth
20210808616:::moons orbiting jupiter celestial bodies orbiting other celestial bodies phases of the moons independent celestial systems
20220808001:::first he saw there are moons orbiting planets so he realized that copernicus was right about there are no celestial center and he thought there must be a force between moons and planet
20220808002:::the weight jupiter and he saw that jupiter is not a whole rock piece
20220808005:::he deduced that the world is not center of universe dispute geocentric model
20220808006:::when the earth is close the jupiter the light comes more faster
20220808007:::he found out that aristotle s geocentric system was wrong the earth is not the center of the universe and not every body revolves around the earth
20220808010:::copernicus said there is circular orbit in the universe the sun is the center of the orbit but galileo deduced when he noticed moons orbit the planet and he uses his own telescope and he observed observe observing with his telescope and he saw 4 moons of jupiter and he noticed moons orbit the planet
20220808013:::galileo find another moons can be and not everything moves around the sun
20220808014:::he found the moons of planets which are closer to planet around faster than the others
20220808016:::when the earth is close to jupiter the light moves faster
20220808018:::he deduced the geocentric model because he looked at the jupiter and found out jupiter has 4 moons so he said the planets are not orbiting around the earth
20220808019:::p i d ispasted the center of the universe is not the earth
20220808022:::he deduced that heliocentric model was not right because according to heliocentric model a planet which is not sun can not have moon gravity
20220808023:::galileo deduced that the jupiter had 4 moons that orbit around the jupiter
20220808024:::he deduced earth is planet too because at that times people believed to church and they accept as earth center of th universe but this observation claims that earth not the center of the world
20220808025:::galileo concluded that they were not stars but moons orbiting around jupiter it was evidence for the copernican model that most celestial objects did not revolve around the earth
20220808026:::the earth was not only planet that have the satellite and the bodies were not perfect
20220808028:::he noticed that heavenly bodies are not perfect 4 satellites revolve orbit of planet
20220808029:::he deduced that earth wasn t the center of universe he said that sun was the center of universe
20220808032:::jupiter had 4 moons orbiting it in an equatorial plane
20220808033:::
20220808034:::the moons of the jupiter orbit the planet with an way described ellipse
20220808035:::the jupiters moons dissapiered sometimes and he mentioned when the distance between jupiter and earth increase moons velocity increase
20220808037:::he said if the moons are orbiting around a planet we might be orbiting too
20220808038:::galileo tried to find a center which is not sun so he looked other planet when he noticed the moons of jupiter he gave up and he taught that sun must be the center of universe earth is center of gravity and has two motion one is around its axis other one is around the sun
20220808039:::every planets have moons and moons round planet as circle moons have orbit period various
20220808041:::he deduced that if the moons of jupiter turning around take the jupiter as a center so there is no one center of objects in the firmament additional the earth is not center of universe the earth is just center of moons move and gravity on earth
20220808043:::he realized orbit and distances after observing the light that between moon and jupiter
20220808044:::the heavenly bodies don t just rotate around the sun but within other axis as well which meant the sun want the center of the universe he noticed that moons orbit the planet while they also have another motion in the the sun s axis not stars
20220808045:::the four galleon moons were the first celestial bodies to be discovered with a telescope galileo reduced for moon around the jupiter he tought geocentric model isn t accurate then he hel to be heliocentric model of universe
20220808046:::when the earth is close to jupiter light moves faster
20220808047:::every light that can we see at nigh couldn t be a star planets has their own orbits include sum
20220808048:::galileo observed that jupiter has 4 moons he deduced that by understanding mechanical structure of machines we can also understand the structure and rules of universe
20220808050:::
20220808051:::galileo expected jupiter had 4 moon with using a telescope while observing that he realized the moons moving in straight lines
20220808052:::he realized that these moons did not orbit sun so this provided strong evidence for copernicus s heliocentric model
20220808053:::there is no just one center of the universe every planets move around sun and its axis for example moon is orbiting around earth some power pull and hold the satellite around the planets
20220808055:::when he observed the jupiter he saw that jupiter has its own moons and moons were like a circle around of jupiter he deduced the geocentric model
20220808056:::telescope newtons light 45 degrees galileo positions change day by day and nightly did this things he made a scientific revolution pendulum discovery height independent formulating the law of falling bodies motion is independent of weight it accelerates at constant rate v g t and 1 it 2 built his own telescope and made amazing discoveries he wrote a book and published well he is symbol of conflict between science and religion moon sphere lunar sphere star that did n't changes it location he determined
20220808057:::he used the telescope and he saw four moons in straight line he said the earth doesn t center of solar system because jupiter doesn t turn around world
20220808058:::he concluded with the result that there is no one center all spheres or bodies have one center jupiter was orbiting the sun and the moons were orbiting jupiter
20220808059:::
20220808060:::
20220808062:::earth is not the center of the universe
20220808063:::galileo founded that the moons has mountains valleys craters and also the moons are not perfect sphere also he founded dark spot on the sun p i d ispasted
20220808066:::galileo noticed four moon around the jupiter then he thought geocentric model is wrong and he holds to be heliocentric model of universe
20220808067:::he realize that every planet pull each other there is a invisible forces makes planets pull each others the big mass and little mass pull each other with some invisible forces called magnetic forces he realize big mass pull little mass
20220808069:::when he observed the jupiter he saw moons circle around the jupiter he saw 4 satellite of the moon so he was disputing geocentric model
20220808070:::galileo said they weren t stars but moons orbiting around jupiter copernican theory says objects don t revolve around earth he found all orbits are elliptical when a moon gets closer to jupiter it moves faster
20220808071:::they were not stars all but moons orbit around jupiter
20220808072:::he deduced jupiter has four moons which are rotating around the jupiter it is the example of disputing with geocentric
20220808073:::he note that in different days there are 4 stars near to jupiter and that are in straight lines after some observations he realized they are in the same line every time of their period that means they were jupiter s moons because jupiter are acted by jupiter gravitational force
20220808074:::galileo discovered telescope and he observed moon and jupiter he noticed that jupiters had four orbits i n previous they believed heavily bodies are perfect but with this observation they noticed that they are not perfect
20220808076:::he deducted world is not the center of the universe earth is only center of gravity and moon and he also deducted
20220808077:::galileo studied mars orbit for this he deduced that sun orbits around earth and other planets orbits around the sun first he thought they were stars that stationary he continued to observe and saw that their positions changed nightly he understood that these new things were satellites of jupiter
20220808504:::p i d ispasted when galileo observed the moons of jupiter through his telescope he deduced that their presence and orbits around jupiter div style color rob 0 0 0 div
20220808604:::he observed the jupiter moon s and he concluded that jupiter moon s become close earlier the earth earlier than excepted
20220808606:::he noticed that jupiter s moons move around the jupiter and the conclusion of galileo s that the earth is just another planet and not the universe s center
20220808607:::galileo deduced that if there are moons orbiting the planet there should be way more planets on the universe and it is endless
20220808608:::he noticed that heavenly bodies are not perfect mountains in moon 4 satellites revolve around jupiter dash disputing geocentric the moon had craters mountains and valleys jupiter had four moons orbiting it in an equatorial plane the milky way was composed of hundreds of unknown stars venus had phases just like the moon there were dark spots on the sun
20220808610:::
20220808616:::he noticed that there must be a force between two or more masses to save the orbital motion
20220808617:::moons are faster when they are approximate the planet and there is no super sphere their movements like lips
20220808703:::p i d ispasted galileo s observations of the moons of jupiter had significant implications for our understanding of the solar system these are galileo s observations of the moons of jupiter were a crucial turning point in the history of astronomy he provided evidence supporting the heliocentric model and challenged the geocentric view of the universe paving the way for a more accurate understanding of the structure of the solar system
20220808705:::the moon acted upon by earth gravity gravity accelerates the moon towards to the earth and it cause moons path to curve or bend this is circle motion of moon determined motion independent the weight
20220808706:::galileo found evidence for copernicus heliocentric theory
20230808004:::there is a force on the moon and this force affects the moon and the moon moves around jupiter elliptical way normally if the net force is zero the object has to go straight line because of the force it goes elliptical
20230808010:::he deduced that planets have their own gravity where different moons can be revolve around it he also found the time that it takes to revolve around it but couldn t understand why it varies
20230808020:::he used the telescope that he made his own to see planets
20230808049:::he deduced that everything didn t orbit around the earth therefore earth couldn t be the center of the universe
20230808055:::if jupiter has its own moon then earth is not special it must be a planet just like jupiter
20230808061:::planets are revolve about a bigger mass planets so earth is revolve around the sun because of that he deduced the orbits are not circular they are ellipse
20230808062:::jupiter has moons satellites earth has moon satellite too so earth is not the center of universe
20230808066:::if a moon is following a circular orbit and if you slow down a moon it lowers its orbit if you accelerate a moon it higher its orbit there were moons orbiting other planets but the planets orbiting the sun so the sun is the center
20230808070:::he noticed that moon s surface was not perfect it had craters before this people thought that moon has a perfect and clean surface planet so galileo discovered important thing that it is not true he also explained that copernicus theories are true that the sun is a center of the universe and center of the planets
20230808075:::galileo used his refraction telescope and observed around jupiter and find out 4 moons moving around jupiter after his observations he deduced everything is not circling earth so earth is not the center of the universe there are stars moons circling around other planets
20230808077:::galileo deduced that having a moon isn t just for earth and not everything turning around world there are another planets have moons orbit and they are turning around planets
20230808602:::he discovered t 2 r 3
20230808608:::galileo deduced that geocentric scheme would be wrong he deduced that earth is another planet and jupiter revolves around the sun not the earth and jupiter has moons that revolve around that just like moon to the earth
20230808609:::galileo made a telescope and he observed the universe he saw craters valleys and mountains on the moon and there are some dark zones on the sun also he saw that jupiter has 4 moons
20230808611:::
20230808613:::every planet has its own force to pull monks to their orbits
20230808615:::orbits are not perfectly circular as they described in holy scriptures they are eclipses
20230808617:::the earth isn t the center of universe
20230808618:::galileo invest telescope and start observation moons or stars when he realize moons or planet did n't move like a circle they move in like elliptic road and he said earth isn t centre of university he said sun is centre of university also earth have to move in two types turn itself and turn around the sun
20230808621:::the galileo using telescope and discovered that moons were the first celestial bodies in the begging galileo thought that they were fixed stars the next observations show that their positions changed on a nightly after all galileo recognized that these were satellites of jupiter which is the new object
20230808623:::he deduced smaller bodies are turn around larger bodies because of that all of the planets including ours are turning around the sun

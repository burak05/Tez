20190808014	:::	 Bodies should have travel at a straight line unless a force act upon a direction.  Moons would not orbit the planet but they did.  Galileo observed this.  And he concluded weight of the planet affected them.  Also he concluded that the motion is independent of the weight.  
20190808021	:::	 He deduced that since the moons orbit the planet instead of being slinged into the void,  Jupiter must have an effect on the moons,  causing them to stay in orbit.  From there he hypothesized that Jupiter's gravity keeps the moons in orbit.

Venus had phases just like the moon. galileo had further developed spy glasses and developed telescope where he could see moon and jupiter.  Galileo  deduced that the observation of moons orbiting Jupiter supported the idea that not all celestial bodies revolved around the earth,  challenging the geocentric model and providing evidence for the heliocentric model proposed by copernicus.  
20200808008	:::	 Most of the former science and scientists believed that Earth is the center of univers and every other heavenly objects orbiting the Earth.  But when he noticed moons of Jupiter he deduced the Earth is not the center of universe also there might be the Earth is orbiting the Sun.

20200808028	:::	 Galileo's observations of Jupiter's moons played a crucial role in the scientific revolution by providing observational evidence that supported the heliocentric model of the solar system.  This,  in turn,  had profound implications for our understanding of the structure of the universe and the relationships between celestial bodies.     
20200808033	:::	 He got some evidence that the geocentric model was not correct.  Because he realized that some objects can revolve around a planet other than the Earth.  He started to believe in the accuracy of the heliocentric model himself.     
20200808038	:::	 Galileo built his own telescope and discovered Jupiter's moons and sunspot and saw that there is mountains and craters on Moon so receognized that celestial bodies should not be perfect. While looking Jupiter's moons,  he recognized that moons orbiting around by Jupiter,  so there should be force for this.  And understood that in universe every object attracts each other the other objects in universe.  Actually we can say that Galileo discovered relationship between satellites and planets.

20230808066	:::	 if a moon is following a circular orbit and if you slow down a moon it lowers its orbit,  if you accelerate a moon it highers its orbit.  there were moons orbitting other planets but the planets orbitting the sun,  so the sun is the center.  
20230808070	:::	 He noticed that moon's surface was not perfect,  it had craters.  Before this,  people thought that moon has a perfect and clean surface planet.  So Galileo discovered important thing that it is not true.  He also explained that Copernicus' theories are true that the sun is a center of the universe and center of the planets.  
20230808075	:::	 Galileo used his refraction telescope and observed around Jupiter and find out 4 moons moving around Jupiter.

And he said earth isn't centre of universty.  He said sun is centre of universty.  Also Earth have to move in two types.  turn  itself and turn around the sun.  
20230808621	:::	 The galileo using telescope and discovered that moons were the first celestial bodies.  in the begging ,  galileo thought that they were fixed stars , the next observations show that their positions changed on a nightly.  After all ,  galileo recognized that these were satellites of Jupiter which is the new object.

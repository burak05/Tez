20190808014:::geocentric approach and heliocentric approach
20210808605:::the two approaches to studying astronomy from the greeks to newton are the geocentric model where earth is considered the center of the universe and the heliocentric model which proposes that the sun is at the center with planets including earth orbiting around it
20230808611:::these are deductive and inductive approach deductive approach is start with generally statements and theory inductive approach start with a question
20200808033:::p i d ispasted geocentric model which places earth to the center of the universe and heliocentric model which places the sun at the center of solar system
20210808025:::aristotalies said earth is center of the universe he thought spheres revolve around the sun but kepler noticed it is false he realized sun is the center of the universe
20220808610:::geocentric and heliocentric models are used to study astronomy
20220808050:::
20210808012:::the first one was observing the heaven and heavenly bodies and the second one was the calculating connection between them with mathematics inductive and deductive approaching to astronomy
20230808621:::the newton use the observational astronomy which is that using telescopes and collect data about the sky and the second one is theoretical astronomy which is that using data to analyze how objects and phenomena work
20220808071:::kepler s law copernican models telescope
20230808609:::heliocentric model the sun is the center of the universe geocentric model the earth is the center of the universe and planets are stationary don t move
20220808069:::newton wanted to study astronomy so he bought astronomy book but he did not know trigonometry so he bought trigonometry book but he did not know euclid so he beginning with euclid one of these is geocentric model geocentric model says that the earth is center of the universe other one is heliocentric model it developed by copernicus heliocentric model says that the planets travel around the sun invented telescope invented microscope and improvement mathematic calculations
20220808023:::one of them is geocentric approach which presumes the earth is in the center and other planets do orbit around the each the other approach is a heliocentric approach which presumed that the earth and other planet were orbiting around the sun
20220808016:::first one is ptolemy s astronomy which is based on earth is on the center geocentric second one is copernic s astronomy which is based on the sun is on the center heliocentric
20230808070:::law of inertia and 2- traditional force these two things were studied but people could not prove
20230808010:::greeks worked on a geocentric model where the center of the universe is earth and everything revolves around it but geocentric model was contradicting with mathematics then heliocentric model is made where planets are revolving around the sun heliocentric model got expanded later because it way more accurate
20210808018:::heliocentric movements they noticed orbits they found out planets spins around themselves and the sun if planets get closer to sun they move faster they move through same areas with same time
20230808602:::for greek s it is geometrical approach for newton it is mechanical approach

20220808024:::predicting and experiamental - observational
20210808061:::greeks used mathematics to explain nature and they did observations but there was a transition between greeks and newton increased knowledge of mathematics and the development of experimental science played big role technological developments and the inventions of instruments such as telescope and microscope and other things let scientist make better observation
20210808044:::aristotle model and copernicus model
20210808033:::greek support and used to idea that what also thought and newton approach to science greeks obtained greeks proposed the geocentric model which means the earth is the center of universe on the other hand newton proposed heliocentric model which means the sun is the center of the universe and the other planets are shining around the sun
20220808703:::p i d ispasted the two main approaches to studying astronomy from the greeks to newton can be broadly categorized as the geocentric and heliocentric models ol style color rob 55 65 81 li in the geocentric model earth is considered to be the center of the universe and all celestial bodies including the sun the moon and the stars are believed to orbit around the earth li li in the heliocentric model the sun is at the center of the solar system and the earth along with other planets orbits around the sun li ol
20220808073:::for greeks there is a geometrical explanation of universe every heaven bodies were perfect but with newton there is mechanical approach which tell us everything under of acts of planets with formulas f gym r 2 and relations with observations
20220808035:::greeks said geocentric model is exist and earth is in the centre and their things are prediction newton say there is no centre and elliptic orbit is exist and his things are certain he prove it thanks to science
20220808025:::first one is aristotle model second one is copernican model aristotle model was continent of perfect circles heavenly bodies was perfect and earth was center of the universe copernican model was more accurate but not a hundred percent correct according to copernican model the earth is not the center of the universe but circles again perfect this was mistake for copernican model
20210808610:::first one the are discovered copernicus solar system and observation about it
20210808016:::great support and used to ideas that what artist thought and he approach to science breaks contained experienced
20230808618:::before revelation and after revelation before revelation greeks use aristotle opinion and they said earth is centre of world after revelation galileo copernicus and bunco etc said sun is the centre of world and earth turn around itself and also they said planet moves with electric
20230808004:::greeks thinks heliocentric and geocentric model geocentric model is earth is the center of the universe and heliocentric model is sun is the center of the universe newton discovered universal gravity force which is f g m1 m2 r 2 and he observes every objects has force on every objects this is the one of the most significant work from newton about astronomy
20230808617:::observation geolinctric system and heliocentric

20210808011:::1 heavenly bodies are perfect and they are orbiting around the world as a circular motion but then galileo invented a telescope and see the mountains and craters in the moon and disproved that heavenly bodies are not perfect 2 the earth is the center of the universe and every planet circle around it geocentric but then some thought that the sun was the center of the universe heliocentric
20200808028:::one of them is geocentric model and other one is heliocentric model

20210808614:::any movement in the sky is cussed by the earths motion earth the center of gravity and lunar the apart movement of the sun is happened because how our spheres and earth move around the sun so the earth had more then one motion
20200808008:::geocentric model which is started with aristotle and guarded by church because of confirming the bible heliocentric model which is started with aristarchus and also not considered until copernicus and galileo s works
20220808028:::euclid thermo aristotelian s model of geocentric and heavenly bodies are perfect
20210808048:::heliocentric model this suggests the sun is in the middle and planets including earth go around it geocentric model this idea says earth is at the center and everything like the sun and planets moves around it

20220808067:::first one is geocentric model which is earth is center of the galaxy and the other planets are turn around with perfect circle way second model is heliocentric models in this model we have many scientist like tycho brace copernicus kepler they improve this model brace thinks the earth is constant because he look the constant stars than measure and planets and stars turn around the sun also he is very accurately after kepler found that the planets aren t perfect they turn with orbital ways that elliptic
20220808074:::one of them geocentric model aristotheles proposed this model he believed that planets revolve around earth and they have circular orbit additional he tought that heavenly bodies are perfect the other one is heliocentric model copernicus galileo and kepler proposed and developed this model according to this model planets revolving around the sun they do nt have circular path and they have elliptical orbit deductive and inductive

20220808044:::geocentric model and heliocentric model geocentric model was introduced by aristotle and put the earth in the center of the universe with other planets orbiting it heliocentric model copernican model was made from the contributions of galileo copernicus descartes and many others and put the sun in the center while other planets rotating around it according to heliocentric model the earth was just the center of lunar orbit and gravitation
20230808608:::there are to models geocentric and heliocentric and to study astronomy two approaches would be observe celestial bodies such as other planets and observe earth
20220808007:::they are geocentric system earth - centered system and heliocentric system sun - centered system
20230808066:::aristotle s approach and newton s approach newton said that the earth is only the center of gravity aristotle thought that the earth was the center of the universe and everything revolves around the earth kepler studied on the moon and realized it circles around in elliptical shapes he dedicated distance and the period of the planets were all the same t sup 2 sup r sup 3 sup he said that the planets sweeps out equal ares on equal periods of time
20230808055:::one approaches was geocentric model which says earth is center of the universe other one was heliocentric model which says sun is center of the universe
20210808006:::p i d ispasted geometrical approach geocentric model the main goal of the geometric approach was to capture and forecast celestial body motions using geometric models using this method an earth centered structure in space is created by placing the earth in the center and all other celestial bodies in orbit around it adhering to a system of interconnected spheres and circles mechanical approach heliocentric model the mechanical method concentrated on the characteristics of scale models of celestial bodies which frequently featured gears levers and other mechanical components as conductors of their motions mechanical approach is sun centered
20230808075:::first one is geometrical approach that greeks did greeks used to model things they work on to understand easier based on modeling second one is mechanical approach mechanical structure of the universe is based on principle mechanics of machines observation

20220808018:::there were geocentric model and heliocentric model the geocentric model says earth is the center of the universe and planets are orbiting around the earth in a circular path heliocentric model says sun is the center of the universe and planets are orbiting around the sun
20220808001:::greeks observed space with just their eyes they didn t use any tools and they didn t want to find any evidence so they made a lot of mistakes because of it but newton observed nature but also tried to prove it by mathematical evidence and he used previous scientist s works like kepler galileo copernicus so his calculations are almost correct and his predictions are absolutely better
20220808077:::theoretical and observational using telescopes or cameras to capture images
20200808805:::
20190808021:::geocentric approach studies astronomy by taking earth as the center of the universe where the planets and the sun orbits around earth heliocentric approach instead takes the sun as the center of the universe and the other planets orbit around the sun

20220808002:::gravity and newton rules
20210808604:::these approaches are sun centered universe and earth centered universe early times people thinked earth is center of the universe and all celestial objects turn around earth since galileo people believe that and catholic church defend that idea however copernicus and galileo prove the earth is sphere and is not center of the universe copernicus thinked sun is the center of universe but when the newton times people discover the sun is not the center

20200808038:::heliocentric and geocentric model according to geocentric model earth is center of universe and according to heliocentric model sun is center of universe with invention of telescope there are so many achievement from greeks to newton greeks was saying celestial bodies are perfect but in reality with invention of telescope we understood that celestial bodies are not perfect greeks was not approaches to astronomy in scientific ways but newton and other scientist do so many experiment and observation about astronomy
20200808080:::1 - ptolemy s geometry geocentric model this model viewed in ancient greek astronomy this model determines the earth was in the center of the universe copernican revolution heliocentric model according to this model and nicolas copernicus the sun was the center of the universe

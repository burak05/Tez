20210808035:::newton experiment shows that the white light is composite when the white light passes through the prism it will separate into different colors of spectrum that is called rainbow colors each color has its own specific angle and that acts as an independent from the ray
20220808013:::newton took an prism and find the spectrum of day light and he separated colors like orange and use another prism to check if orange gather other colors and make a white light again but it wasn t
20220808706:::newton did prism experiment and separated spectrum of daylight into its colors with lenses
20220808070:::newton sent a white light through a prism then white light came out of prism with new colors of spectrum rainbow colors
20220808617:::he purchased a prism it was known that rainbow effect can be obtained by transmitting white light he isolated the orange color and pass it through second prism he found no other colors existed behind the second prism so he concluded that white color is made up other colors
20220808063:::firstly newton did that a ray of white light passes thought a prism at 45 degree the light divide into the colors of rainbow and then he did that same things for orange color in the end the orange light not dividing basic entities
20220808019:::p i d ispasted newton s prism experiment it was to refract light onto a piece of wood into which had been drilled a small hole
20180808086:::newton bought prism because he know that prism can show rainbow effect when white light is transmitted into hooke exclude orange color and he found no color exist behind second prism so he understood white color is made up form other that is dispute hooke
20220808029:::he send white light to a prism and that prism gave spectrum colors rainbow colors and then he took just one light from the first prism blue red orange etc and put another prism and he saw that the light was still same with this experiment he dispute robert hooke
20220808014:::he used a prism first he reflect the daylight to wood then he reflect the daylight to a prism the daylight separated of their colors and he found the colors in the daylight
20210808014:::double prism experiment he put second prism to isolated orange color
20220808059:::
20220808006:::newton did the prism experiment he took a prism the white light passed through the prism and there were several colors on the spectrum then he isolated the orange color again the orange color passed through the second prism consequently he said that the white color consists of colors these colors are not added to the white color
20230808077:::hooke said light is result of pressure after that newton said if it is pressure you can see at nights but you can not see at nights he did prism experiment so he prove he is right and hooke is wrong
20220808504:::p i d ispasted newton proposed that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors and demonstrated this by passing light through a prism he argued for the particle theory of light suggesting that light is made up of particles hooke advocated for a wave theory of light opposing newton s particle theory div style color rob 0 0 0 div
20190808014:::newton bought a prism because it was known that prism shows rainbow effect when white light is transmitted into it he excluded orange color sent it through the second prism he found no color exists behind second prism so he understood white color is made up from others that s how he disputed hooke
20210808605:::newton conducted prism experiments that demonstrated the decomposition of light into its spectra he argued with hooke about it
20230808611:::newton did that he send light into a prism that refracted the light onto a white piece of paper with that he saw different colors
20200808033:::newton passed white light through a prism at a 45 - degree angle and saw that the incoming light split into the colors of the rainbow
20210808025:::he used two prism he used white light and on the first one and orange light on the second one he realized second prism not execute any colour so he noticed that white light consumes at the colours so he against the hooked views
20220808610:::newton used a prism to let white light enter through it and create rainbow spectrum as a result he isolated orange light when orange light enter through another prism it didn t create another color newton concluded that white light is combination of other colors he called this spectra
20220808050:::
20210808012:::he made a prism experiment to dispute there were two prism first one was for light second one was for the rest color one color of light when the last color it can be any color pass the second prism there was just this color
20230808621:::hooke claim that white is pure color newton bought two prism and put them together firstly he strike the white color and behind the first prism he saw the orange color after than behind the second prism he saw nothing therefore he claim that the white is include all colors and prism separate all of the colors and newton claim that the white is not pure color
20220808071:::newton founded white light s why being prisml spectrum refract light onto a piece of wood into has drill a small house
20230808609:::hooke said that light has something but newton did not agree with him he said if he was true when we run at nights we would see everywhere brighter
20220808069:::hook was thinking white color is pure newton used two prism and white color travel with 45 degrees angles then curate color spectrum according to newton if white color is pure white color did not accurate color spectrum each color has spectrum with unique angles independently other colors
20220808023:::newton used a prism to split the day light when light rays passed through the prism newton saw that they split into different spectrum of light rays each light ray had its unique angle that makes with prism
20220808016:::newton send the white light into prism and he saw different colors he learn that white light contains all colors then he isolated orange light and send into prism and he saw only orange
20230808070:::p i d ispasted robert hooke discovered microscopic world newton made experiments about light and its spectrum in microscopic field he understand that white color is made up other colors div style color rob 36 36 36 div div style color rob 36 36 36 div div style color rob 36 36 36 div
20230808010:::hooke theorised that prism adds colors to light that comes inside of it newton send a day light to a prism at a 45 degree angle then put on a filter to take only one of the colors when he send the filtered color again to a prism he saw that only that color of light came out of prism so he deduced that prism doesn t add colors but the daylight already has rainbow colors inside of it
20210808018:::when light passing through a prism white light gets divided with color spectrum
20230808602:::he use prism light goes through prism and divided into beams he blocked some of those beams then he use another prism to light go through there is nothing new only the light from the first prism that didn t blocked it is the same light that didn t divide into new beams
20210808022:::white light passing the prism and result wide beam display to spectrum of colors by analysis of spectra we may know lifecycle of the universe newton invented reflecting telescope hook invented microscope he isolated of light and yield the microscope
20200808026:::hooke supposed that light was pure white and the other color adding on it on the other hand newton s proved that day light has rainbows colour with prism color experiments
20220808076:::newton make light prism experiment to dispute hook in this experiment newton put a prism in front of the day light and day light broke and newton saw rainbow after that he put another prize front the orange light and he saw orange light was not change he understood day light contain rainbow lights
20220808048:::hooke taught said that other colors were added to the pure white light newton checked if the white ray was pure he used a prism to control it he sent white ray to prism to pass through it with 45 degree angle and he saw that white light split into colors
20210808062:::newton made an experiment to explain day light to dispute hooke he send a light and futons to piece of paper the paper has hole in it then the light return he saw different colors and find the spectrum
20220808607:::font mstmutation 1 msttexthash 1691508 stash 0 he used 2 prisms first one for making the spectrum he font font mstmutation 1 msttexthash 116103 stash 1 separated one color it was orange and then used the second prism to look if hooke was right apparently he was not because the light didn t turn out to be seen as spectrum it was only orange font
20210808615:::newtons crucial experiment was to refract light onto a piece of wood into which had been drilled a hole and he was able to obtain a beam of light with a pure color he was able to show that blue light for instance when refracted through a second prism turned again only blue light this is the experiment that newton has been through
20220808024:::he did experiment the show us to light has delay but not instant
20210808061:::newton devised the reflecting telescope his experiment showed that white light is composite and consisted in taking beam of white light and passing it through a prism the result was a wide beam displaying spectrum of colors newton adopted a particulate definition of light and he believed that that light must travel from the object to the viewer newton quo s transmission theory assumed that light had a velocity swell but later it was observed that light has wave qualities swell
20210808044:::newton bought a prism and put it to sunlight and used the second prism on orange light if hooke was right the second light must be white but orange light did not change
20210808033:::newton sent the light into a prism so the light refracted onto a white paper in this way he observed the spectrum of color providing evidence for his theory that light is composed of particles and disputing hooke s wave theory of light
20220808703:::he demonstrated that white light is made up of a spectrum of colors each having a specific wavelength hooke proposed a wave theory of light suggesting that light is a wave phenomenon he criticized newton s particle theory of light and had a general disagreement with newton over various scientific matters newton s experiments with prisms were part of his broader exploration of optics and the nature of light
20220808073:::for hook other colors are added to white light when it pass through in prism i n newton s experiment he firstly passed light in first prism and show us rainbow color and he named that as spectrum then he isolated orange light and it passed through second prism but it still orange light that means hook was wrong white light was composite of rainbow colour
20220808035:::newton had a beam of daylight pass trough a glass prize and he discovered pure white light breaks into other colours which is spectrum
20220808025:::he used a prism he provided to sun light through a prism and then he saw rainbow and then he separated one of the colors to the second prism and nothing changed and this was proof that white lights component of rainbow colors light and also every single color have not constituent part
20210808610:::newton did to many experiment about day light but one of imported this rainbow effect
20210808016:::hooke supported this corpuscular theory of light when newton propose an alternative theory that light was composed of particles but also exhibited wave like properties although newton proposed a theory that light exhibited both particle and wave properties and he said that light is while but home thought different hooke supported the idea that light was solely composed of particles
20230808618:::newton realize when day light white go to in a prism white light operate rainbow colours then he add another prism and tested orange colour could operate another colours but it didn t work because just white colour can operate another colours
20230808004:::newton used white light for this experiment and he used prism and he observes white light contains all colours but hooke thinks the white light is pure however newton proved his idea with his prism experiment
20230808617:::first newton used a prism to deflect light when light is deflected it is realized that different colors so hooke thinks that prisms produce different lights however newton deflects light again but this time newton used orange light that was produced the white light at first deflection but this time only realized the orange light in other words newton realized the white light isn t pure and realized light s spectrum
20210808017:::according to hooke light was a pure white but according to newton light is a mixed colors so he was use 2 prism for dispute hooke the first prism was a colorless and second one is a orange after that he setup the light for pass the light through first prism and than he put the 2 line object this object have a little space between they and the light pass it through and than the light pass through orange prism and if newton think true the light should be orange and in the last step light was orange so newton was accurate
20220808041:::he check if white light is pure p i d ispasted it is known that white light will create a rainbow effect when passed through a prism and he contained this observe and he isolated the orange send the orange color to the prism and behing of prism he saw just orange color he concluded white light is composed of spectrum of color the spectrum of color explained as weakness of white light every color behave independent and they have precise and specific angle of retraction p i d ispasted
20220808033:::he concluded that the light contains rainbow lights
20220808052:::he blocked all sunlight except a bit from window put prism and separated or blocked one color for example orange he put another prism in front of this color and then spectrum does not appear again this means white light has all the light this spectrum does not caused by prism itself
20200808009:::
20220808616:::he used a prism glass to observe refraction of white light and saw that white light concludes the different colors of light it was not about the weakness level of the white light itself
20210808021:::newton experimented shows that he white light is complicated when the white light passes thought the prison it will separated the seven colors light that is called rainbow colors
20200808505:::separate light sectors his own reactor reflector mayan telescope
20210808038:::newton using prism 45 degree split the white light to rainbow colors later he isolated orange color and used another prism he realized that orange light didnot turn into white light so he discovered that prism does n't add lights every light has his own fundamentals and can not be divide
20220808047:::hooke said that glass prism created the colors when he refracted sunlight with a prism newton isolated colors and passed a single color through a prism one color couldn t be separated into a different color p i d ispasted
20230808623:::he divided the white light to its components by using a prism then took the orange color to another prism again but orange remained orange by that he disputed hook
20220808039:::he explained that the white color is not pure the day light is straight light the day lights includes rainbow lights
20220808056:::light comes from prism and every light has its own road and angle what did newton do about light discovered that white light was composed of the colored rays of the spectrum reflecting telescope the result is a wide beam displaying a spectrum of colors he proved that the light isn quo t pressure transmission theory wave like qualities newtons transmission theory light is the result of pressure on the aether
20220808032:::the color spectrum was explained as weeks of white light light moved across the spectrum from white bright to darkness weakness increases newton separate the orange from light
20210808011:::newton put the white light to a prism and there was a rainbow after that he separated the orange color from others after that he put another prism into the orange color and it gived only orange according to hooke it should give a rainbow again
20200808028:::newton s works on optics is the prism experiment that is the most important one
20220808043:::newton said that the day light is white if the day light passing through the prism we will observe various colours these are determine according the frequency of colours
20230808062:::he developed a reflecting telescope white light through prism they said prism is not reflecting just breaking the structure of light then newton tried it with orange light and only orange light appeared that means it isn t breaking the structure when refraction happens in white light it separates to rainbow s colors because white light has the rainbow s colors inside
20220808053:::he bought a prism and he pass light ray through prism he saw that light disputed to rainbow it means there is another couple inside of the light ray
20200808504:::light prism when light passing prism it split different color of light
20220808045:::newton bought a prism then he realized newton pure white light isn t pure it has different color and then he was able to show that blue light for instance when refracted through a second prism yielded again only blue light
20210808614:::newton s crucial experiment was to refract light onto a piece of wood into which had been drilled a small hole in this way he was able to obtain a beam of light with a pure color he was able to show that blue light for instance when refracted through a second prism yielded again only blue light
20200808008:::he bought 2 prism and then pass the day light trough first prism that gave him a rainbow of colors after that he isolate orange light and pass the other lights through second prism there were no lights that passed through second prism
20220808028:::color spectrum was explained weakness of white light in spectra from white bright to blue darkness weakness increases
20210808048:::br i d ispasted newton used a special glass to show sunlight has many colors not just one which was different from what hooke thought about light
20230808061:::newton has made an experiment he used prism and because of the refracting the light has spectrum so he discover spectrum he use prism into a daylight then he put the prism front of orange light but prism does n't change color of light when its orange so the white is including all lights
20220808066:::newton bought a prism p i d ispasted newton saw that pure white light is not pure p i d ispasted to prove this she isolated the orange light and tried again with the second prism
20220808046:::newton reflect write light into prism and he saw different colors he learn that write light contains all colors then he send orange light prism and he saw only orange
20230808613:::
20210808066:::newton discovered that if a ray of white light passesthrough a prism at a 45 - degree angle the light is split into the colors of the rainbow
20210808056:::newton made white light through prism then the white light separated into different color of spectrum this color was rainbow color and newton found that each those colors has its own angle
20220808034:::he observed the light with a prism
20220808067:::newton throw lights into the prism with 45 degrees then lights divided get out with separately way independent ray after he throw orange color but it didn t divided so with this he dispute hooke
20220808074:::robert hooke is believed that light is color added to the pure wight light but newton did not agree with this idea he checked if white color is pure or not he purchased a prism i t was known rainbow effects he isolated a orange color he refracted a white light and pass through it to second prism they noticed that they did not found any other color behind to second prism they conclude that white light is not pure and it made up other colors
20210808612:::newton s experiment was these he brought 2 prism and went a lightness room he took a light source and made the light on thought one prism and divided it into it s spectrum then he used 2 sons like papers or something like that to isolate one spectrum after he isolated he made the light go trought the second prism
20200808045:::he purchased prism and observed transmitting white light and think rainbow effect isolated the orange color and and pass through to second prism
20220808037:::hooke says day light is becomes colors and colors are becomes colors newton prism off the light and get the orange and prism the orange and get orange not all the colors
20210808616:::robert hooke color spectrum is weakness of white light first law of motion law of interim body remains at rest or moves in a straight line unless there is outer force second law formula f m 2
20210808076:::newton did that he sent a light to piece of paper to see what color is return to white paper he saw different colors
20220808604:::he observed the white light movements that when pass through the prism and he concluded colour light is independent each other each light reflects different angle he also find that if white light come with 45 angles to prism we observed rainbow light robert hooke explain the day light thanks to newton s prism experiment
20220808022:::hooke said that prism adds color to light that comes inside of it newton said white color includes other colors and he discovered white color spectrum
20220808010:::he passed through orange color to a white color with using 2 prisms not sure about that but maybe he use his telescope and make some observation and he measure and accused to dispute hooke and independent ray spectrum white color is not pure
20220808705:::that pressure from the sun transmit the light to the eye for example at the night to create pressure against air and eyes a person must improve his vision by running forward the light has velocity and wave - like qualities newton experiment show that the white light is composite when the light passes thought the prism it will be separate into different colors of spectrum that is called rainbow
20210808042:::newton did that he send light into a prism that refracted the light onto a white piece of paper with that he saw different colors
20230808020:::he said light isn not pure it is components of colors rays of spectrum
20220808044:::he used a piece of wood which he had dried and using this piece of wood he explained how daylight went through it and he also used a second prism and made orange light go through it which didn t spilt into colors and was the most basic ray on its own after making a beam of white light go through a prism and separate into bunch of colours
20230808608:::newton did the prism experiment he shined sunlight through a prism and observed that it s not a single beam but a package of rays made out of different wavelengths he broke the sunlight from 45 degree angle then observed the rainbow colors caused by different wavelengths having different speeds
20220808007:::hooke found the rainbow colors in the cells and thought white color is pure newton checked if the white color is pure he passed the white light through a prism and it displayed colored rays which was already known and then he isolated orange color and passed it through a second prism and then checked if rainbow colors will be displayed again however no there was no color but orange so he concluded that white color is composed of coloured rays
20230808066:::he used two prisms he used white light on the first one and and orange light on the second one the white light returned rainbow while the orange light did not execute any colour then he noticed that white light consumes all the colours which was against hooke s theory
20230808055:::he passes day light from one prism the light form a spectrum then he isolate orange light and passed throw an other prism he saw that this time there was no spectrum just orange he confused that prism does n't adding colors but the white color has all colors with it
20210808006:::the color spectrum was interpreted in newton s optics as the white light s weakness and newton conducted the double slit experiment to refute hooke s wave theory of light this experiment established the particle theory of light by proving that light is made up of particles
20230808075:::he did the experiment in a dark room there is a small hole that light comes inside from when sun light goes through the prism colors that creating white occurs that explained colors create white coming together
20200808015:::newton did too many experiment about in this subject his experiment s name is white light break experiment
20200808003:::the color spectrum was explained as weakness of white light that is as light moved across the spectrum from white bright to blue darkness weakness increases - robert hooke p i d ispasted manipulating light yielded the microscope robert hooke discovered microscopic world until then it was not known to humans galileo looked large object dash hooke small hooke saw how small animals function he even discover small rectangles in plant tissues that he called the cell hooke saw rainbow colors in thin layers of tissues he tought colors are added to the pure white color light and dark dash episode i bac
20220808058:::hooke had a day light - white - thought as colors are levels of dominance newton did the prism experiment which shows the day light - white - is contributed by six main colors rainbow colors
20220808018:::he purchased the prism he pass through white light through first prism and then he isolated the orange color from the first prism he pass through orange color from second prism and found out it has an independent ray spectrum he concluded white color is not pure it s made of other colors
20220808001:::he wanted to know if white light pure or made of something so he used prism for his experiment he sent sunlight to a prism with 45 degrees so he saw that it was splitter other colors he chosen a color and used prism again but just for that color and it didn t change so white light was made of other colors
20220808077:::newton refracted light onto a piece of wood into which had been drilled a small hole hooke sent the light to prism with 45 degrees the light refracted and separated its spectrum from white light to blue dark also he concluded that light s weakness increases from white light to blue dark
20200808805:::he arranged a prism so the sun light coming from a hole of a shatter he had made in his bedroom window so it passes and projected a color light on a screen then he isolated one of the colors by a slit and passed it in into another prism he only saw the the isolated color
20190808021:::he split the day light into its components using a prism thus showing that day light is not a single color but a combination of seven colors
20220808606:::newton did prism experiment to observe if day light pure or has more color in it
20200808063:::refract light with glass prism
20220808005:::p i d ispasted newton used 2 prisms to split white light into a spectrum of colors this was already known that prism provide us a spectrum in that time then he observed no separation when split one color into the second prism after this case he decided that white light is composed of various colors
20220808051:::he choosed 2 prism after that he isolate the orange colour and put the orange colour thought second prism he did not execute any light so he concluded white colour made up another colours
20220808608:::newton checked if white color is pure he purchased a prism it was known that rainbow effect can be obtained by transmitting white light he isolated the orange color and pass it through second prism he found no other colors existed behind the second prism so he concluded that white color is made up other colors called spectra
20220808060:::
20220808026:::hooke observed the tissues and he saw the rainbow colors he tought that the colors are added to pure white light but newton had experiment and the white light move through a prism at 45 degree by him the white light were split into the rainbow colors and he isolated the orange the orange color moved through a prism by him and there were no any color behind of the prime he tough that the white light made up the rainbow color
20230808049:::at the time there were 2 theories about the light one was robert hooke s and the other was newton s hooke was saying that the white light was pure and the colours were added by the materials that it went through newton was saying that white light already involved other colours he brought 2 prisms and went to a lightness room he took a light source and made the light go through one prism and divided it into it s spectrum then he used 2 sons like papers or something like that to isolate one spectrum in this case it was orange light after he isolated he made the light go through the second prism now if hooke was right the prism should have added the other colours to the light again but it didn t happen which means newton was right
20220808002:::i don t know what to say sorry for my answers
20210808604:::newton s experiment is light prism it is a triangle prism made by glass newton use this prism and separate day light to rainbow colors
20200808062:::he use the pyramid prism to show the white light get participated to other lights which means that the compose of the all lights is the white light
20220808062:::he used another prism and learned that the white is the combine of all colors
20230808615:::he used prism to observe the behavior of light he observed that when white light is transferred within prism it separates rainbow colour after isolating a colour and transferred again into second prism it does n't change that shows that white light is not pure and made up of spectrum
20220808055:::hooke was thinking white light is pure newton with using two prisms firstly isolated the orange color and after use other prism and he observed that every light color has own refracting spectrum angle
20210808065:::
20200808020:::newton said white color is not pure newton used a prism he observe the white color through the prism and find out that white is contains all colors and not pure
20220808038:::hooks said prism adds color to each other so newton worked on it he used prisms he sent the white light to prism with a 45 degree and white light split to other colors each color has own specific spectrum and reflection s angle he find white light composed of other color also he sent orange to a prism and he saw orange again he said just white color is composed of other color
20200808072:::invented microscope experiment newton did to explain the day light to dispute hook so microscope
20220808072:::he proved that white light composed of the other lights he send white light rays into a prism and white light splits into rainbow colors and isolated the orange light and passed it again in a prism and orange light doesn t split any other colors so he concluded white color made up of other colors
20200808038:::newton purchased prism and did so many experiments with prism he passed into day light to prism and then separate orange color from others recognized that white color - day light contains other colors of rainbow also newton designed telescope for observe planets - large object robert hooke invented microscope for observe microworld - microorganisms robert hooke looked into plants with microscope and saw the many rectangles later he called rectangles cell
20200808080:::newton used prisms to show that white light is made up of different colors against what people believed before and helping us understand how daylight and colors work
20190808035:::he used a prism he send light trough it and see a rainbow effect then he isolated the orange color and pass it trough a second prism he see there is no other color and said that colors can be transmit by white color
20220808057:::newton purchase a prism and he used for refraction from prism first of all he refraction white light and he just reflecting orange color to prism he hope this experimentation result orange color show white light but this not happened so that he thought white light is combined color of rainbow colors
20190808034:::he did it with a prism he split the white light to colours then let the only orange light to another prism but so he didnot find another colors segment
20210808005:::the color spectrum was explained the weakness of white light the light pass through the spectrum from white bright to blue darkness weakness increases later he purchase the prism he isolated the orange color and it passed it through the second prism then he noticed there is no other colors existence behind the second prism he concluded the white color is made up other colors

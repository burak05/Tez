Now you will see your finger with different angle  of background.  They discovered Retrograde movement like this method. Different point is they used lots of calculations and think eyes of our example they didn't close their eyes but they make calculations on different times.

According to Ptolemy's view, the planets have  epicycles and because of these epicycles, planets' motion were appeared to move to backward movements for orbiting.  For epicycle's idea, he thought planets move around itself . According to Ptolemy, Earth is the center of the universe( This is geocentric model.) and Earth is stationary. Sun, Moon, planets ans stars are rotation around Earth.  Copernicus' view is the planets have different velocity in different space.  In his view, The planet that is closest to Sun is faster than other planets' velocity. Thus, difference of velocity cause this retrograde movement. Copernicus' model is heliocentric model. The Sun is the center of universe. Earth and other planets move around the Sun as circle orbiting.	20
20180808016	:::	In the early days, people thought planets were orbiting around the Earth and Earth was the center of the universe. They thought planets were also orbiting on they own while they were orbiting around the Earth. Later, they realized that Earth wasn't the center of the universe but planets including Earth were orbiting around the Sun while they were also turning around themselves but not orbiting around themselves.    Also people thought that orbits were circular because they believed circular shapes were perfect and it was suiting their religious thoughts but Kepler proved that planets can't move in circular orbits but they should be moving in elliptic orbits. Because in a circular orbit type of moving wouldn't work with Mars. So Kepler found out that Solar System and Mars' movement can make sense only if the orbits are in ellipse shape. As a result of that a planet's coordinates are not same according to Sun all the time. So, a planet should move faster as it gets closer to the Sun and should move slower while getting further. A planet is fastest in the closest position to Sun and slowest at furthest.	12

Ptolemy, looked at the fix stars and think that maybe there is another orbit is doing by planets. Planets move around their orbits as well. This move named as retrograde. (Disproved by Copernicus)	16
20180808066	:::	In general there are two description of explain retrograde motion by Ptolemy and Copernicus.  Ptolemy who worked on Geocentric Model said that retrograde motion is because of the epicycles. Because in the epicycles planets ( such as Mars ) are revolve around the it's own orbit. So because of that when the other planets revolve around the sun's orbit, planets that move on in their epicycles and because of this they appear to move backwards according to the Earth.  Copernicus who worked on Heliocentric Model said that retrograde motion is because of the planet's distances from the center (Sun).When the planets closer to the sun their speed is greater than the further planets. Copernicus claimed that Earth is closer to the sun than the other planets that do retrograde motion such as Mars and because of that Earth had to faster than the Mars therefore in the beginning Mars seems to move forward. But Earth complete its period earlier than the Mars and then Earth pass the Mars and because of that Mars seems to move backwards.	20

In Galileo's model;  Universe is infinite, and it has uncountable stars and Earth is not center of the universe. Earth's movement around the sun is create morning and nights.	16
20180808072	:::	At the time that geocentric model was accepted, the data which was acquired from the observations of other planets and their orbiting did not fit in the geocentric model. Since, model was supported by Aristotle and believed by most of the society, people and scholars tried to find a reason for this situation by sticking the cosmos model which was wrong. Retrograde movement was the reasonable and meaningful explanation for such observations. Another similar example of this situation resulted with Tycho Brahe's cosmos model. Since he tried to fit his data to the wrong model where the Earth is the center, he come up with an wrong model. According to his model, the Earth was in the center of the Universe and the sun was revolving around it in a circular orbit. At the same time, other planets were moving around the Sun in a circular orbit again. However, thanks to Johannes Kepler who reanalyzed the data of Tycho's observations, the new model which is heliocentric model started to find support. In 1609, he published his first book that states his 1st and 2nd which states that Orbits are in ellipse shape and equal area swiped by the planets in equal time. After 10 years, in 1619 he published his second book which states the 3rd law that it there is a ratio between the period of an planet and its semi major axis that is P^2/a^3 = 1 where P is the period and a is the semi major axis. If we rewrite for this equation for the Earth, we get T^2/R^3 = 1 where T is an Earth year and R is a distance between the Sun and the Earth which is equal to 1 astronomical unit.	12

The planets are faster while they were close to the Sun and slower when they were away from it. If you were to draw a straight line from a planet to the Sun and continue drawing it until it reaches the orbit line, you would effectively split the orbit into two equal parts. Not only that but the divided areas of the orbit would be equal to each other. The planet will always clear the two parts of this orbit lines at the same time. 	12

20190808067	:::	The Mars, it was the most tilting planet for the pre-scientist, but to explain it we need to know how we can say that an object has a velocity. We can say that object has a velocity by looking it if it moves, but if we move with the object we cannot understand the movement of the object. Although many of the pre-scientists did not know about it like Aristotle so they thought that - since the earth does not move - the other planets and the sun must moving around the earth. With that way they took the base earth to look and measure the velocity. But earth had velocity on its own so sometimes the an another planet like The Mars would appear to be moving backwards, retrograde. Taking the earth as a base was the geo-centric model. Mars tilted scientist for many years and they did not even try to change their system.	12

20190808082	:::	Retrograde motion is a backward motion but it is not actually moving back. Planets move in same direction and seen as make a motion to the backward but it caused by planets being lapped each other. Since planet with the inside orbit moves faster and planet with the outside is slower, each sees that they are moving to the backwards. We can give a real life example to that, for instance, if there are two car and one of them is stopped, other is moving and when we are in the moving car, we may see the other car as moving backwards.	0
